  - I think it will be. In addition to the other answers on this post, $200,000 in tokens have been allocated to the development team and no one can withdraw for a year.

If the coin can perform in the markets and have mass adoption through the marketing channels they have and are establishing with the name recognition and the verifiable information present looks and bodes very well for this project. The translation into many languages is also telltale of the potential success of the coin. Finally, many people show concern about the number of coins available among other concerns. Although they have $21 billion in tokens, $4 billion will be the initial circulation. The rest will be mined. If the coin can become successful in multiple markets as they are targeting, $4 billion will not be much in tokens as the demand will surge. The coin is already showing pent up demand as they hit the $40 million cap 11 days prior to the original close date and people are still trying to get the tokens. Those are all promising signs.

  - Suppose you were to create your own cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrencies are worthless commodities by themselves and the only value they have is what its users perceive it to have. So to make users adopt your coin and to educate people about the uses of your coin and to initially sell some of your coins, you start an ICO. An ICO will usually tell the world what your coin is all about, how it works, why is it different, what is your business model, the team that is behind the coin, etc. All this information lets a potential investor evaluate this venture and decide if he or she wants to make an investment in it or not. In an ICO, an investor can buy coins even before the coins are actually in circulation. Purchase methods could be either in fiat currencies e.g. USD or in other cryptocurrencies e.g. Ethereum or Bitcoin.

It is much less in price than other coins and one could easily buy some big amount of it. XRP are doing well from quite some time and these movements should not be ignored by the investor I guess.

Get your self educate with this market, do some investment plan, distribute you investment ration amongst some good Cryptocurrencies, it is still the early phase of this revolution, you are still in early stage.

When you have a feeling you kinda understand the market, go ahead and start investing I am using exactly the setup described above. 
- - What is the future of cryptocurrency? Is it a good investment?
  - I just answered the same question few moments ago. Here read on. Bitcoin is still in very young phase and not every one knows about it. Yet, large scale industries and tech companies are to adapting it and making it mainstream. Take the fact into account, companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Expedia, Bloomberg, Dell, Tesla and even universities and colleges accept bitcoins for tuition fees. Only 6 blocks per hour can be mined and there are 4 years per cycle. 
- - What bills are you paying in cryptocurrency outside cryptocurrency land?
  - Thanks for the A2A. None, however, I have a Bitcoin client that I write and generate content for and they pay me in Bitcoin and I love it. I wish I had 3 more. None at the moment beyond having bought occasional Amazon gift cards when they were on sale. So I guess that counts as a bill paid indirectly? Long term capital gains tax takes more time. I have far more than enough liquid cash running to pay the bills.

  - I like TRON TRX in the long run for these reasons. Things I don’t like about TRON I don’t know if it will electrify current markets, but given that it’s one of my larger investments at the moment I sure hope so! It’s my opinion that TRON has too much support from the likes of Ali Baba and as a result of that, the Chinese government for it to fizzle out. Be cautious on Tron. 
- - Are there exchanges that allow cryptocurrency high frequency trading?
  - There are currently no cryptocurrency exchanges that can handle any where near a professional level of trading. But then the volume of trades is infinitesimal when placed against any mature market. I’m not sure that HFT trading isn’t a bit of a nonsense at this point in cryptocurrencies. And frankly there are tremendous inefficiencies to take advantage of. HFT trading is not necessary. 
- - What are the factors that determine the value of cryptocurrencies?
  - Mostly high demand, low supply and acceptability. You can even create your own but that won’t make sense, right? A great example is Bitcoin and runner up in this race is Ethereum. Bitcoin is still the king and not going anywhere for next 5–6 years. Even market experts say 1 Bitcoin can be worth a million in next 10 years. Just look at its price, came downbest time to buy after August 1st BIP issue but still over $2000 I’ll bet my money on Bitcoin. 
- - What makes Monero XMR the cryptocurrency special?
  - Under the proxy of “fake news” everybody from Quora to Yahoo censors opinion, tradition and science that it feels does not conform to its accepted consensus opinion. This heavy handed approach to controlling the internet will obviously backfire. One way this will happen is that the harder you try to repress others online, the higher the chance they will start using encryption and other manners to escape censorship and control. Monero obscures sender, recipient and amount of transaction. 
- - Is cryptocurrency legal?
  - Both yes and No. The government is at a fix and right now don’t have any mechanism to regulate the cryptocurrency.

- - Why are governments around the world banning cryptocurrency trading?
  - To answer your question specifically, because the technology that produces bitcoins is out of the domain of most governments, and the currency itself puts money in the hands of the people instead of re-routing it via the government. In India, the Central Bank i.e. RBI has only cautioned traders and not banned the currency. They anyway cannot ban it, since it is not legal tender to begin with. It is a trading asset, anyone can keep trading, and pay tax to the government. 
- - What is your opinion on Dash cryptocurrency?
  - Dash Core Features It’s has great marketing and an interesting approach to its community, but overall a weaker technology stack than some of its competitors in the privacy token market. And even in the instant payments market, competitors like Lightning and Raiden are offering the ability to do what instant send can do and a lot more. I think the team behind Dash can make this work, but they’re going to have to find a market where it can remain competitive for years to come. 
- - What is the future of GPU cryptocurrency mining?
  - Not promising at all. GPUs have a few cores vs Asics which have 100 or more cores and much more energy efficient. Unless there is a significant increase in demand for Asic resistant crypto such as vertcoin, the business aspect of GPU crypto mining is gloomy. It currently takes about $25 worth of electricity to validate a bitcoin transaction. This is more than what I would pay a normal bank. This premium only makes sense for few transactions, often illegal ones. 
- - Should one invest in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies?
  - It really depends. I personally advise people not to even bother looking at anything other than Bitcoin and Ethereum for their first year of investing. “But there are so many exciting coins that have great white papers, solid dev teams and promise to do so much!” True, and perhaps I will miss out on a few unicorns. I personally believe in the philosophy of “don’t spread yourself thin” and “don’t try the advanced moves before you learn the basics”.

You would continue earning a profit with this until your electricity costs more than $0.29 assuming your rig doesn’t have any other power hungry parts attached and uses about 200w, which is when you would start to lost money. However, CPUs with less threads, like the Intel Core i7–6700k and Intel Core i7–7700k have a much lower hashrate of around 300 h/s, which would still be fine if you had free or really cheap electricity.

However, you may very well buy bits of a mainstream currency that has more backers and that has a more solid plan for the future.

- - Is it legal to create a virtual open investment fund with cryptoshares, invest in stocks and assets, then sell those shares in cryptocurrency or fiat money, then payout returns in cryptocurrency or fiat money?
  - This is an interesting question, from a couple of perspectives. I don’t think there would be anything “virtual” about the investment fund itself.

The “magical” hook here appears to be the concept of “cryptoshares”, which I think is just a representational geometry as a proxy for the relationship between the shares and the holder of the shares. 
- - What is your view on cryptocurrency macroeconomically?
  - Consider, China and Russia are itching for an alternative to USD for their petro trading. China has a lot to lose if they let capital controls run free, yet China allows individual Bitcoin ownership yet bans central exchanges, as well as prevents access to US exchanges. Fishy, right? Putin also recently met with Vitalik founder of Ethereum and announced a tax on unverified incoming cryptocurrency funds - in essence legitimizing cryptocurrency.

- - Do you think investing in cryptocurrency is still profitable?
  - I’m 60% bearish and 40% bullish at the moment. The market moves could be highly manipulated because of low trading volumes, so big players can easily move price another 1000 dollars a day either direction. If BTC fails to move through 11700 and falls below 7.8-8k, alts would decline in BTC price also. However, in this case, money probably would start licking from the crypto market.

- - Whats your biggest loss on cryptocurrency?
  - So far I havent experienced any losses. I have sold some of my biggest gainers to diversify into a myriad of altcoins, and whenever one of those doubled, sold half and moved the funds into several promising ICO’s. Im astounded that you would be asking for a list of the losers since the crypto market is so volatile. Why on earth would anyone sell a crypto for a loss? Be patient and wait for a month or even six months and then sell once it has recovered. As you well know, you should only be putting money into cryptos that you are able to do without, so why would anyone want to worry about a loss in funds they considered lost at the start? When I began putting money into cryptos in 2016 there were only two options available so I wrote off the $3000 I put into BTC and Ether and considered it lost. If you are serious about putting funds into any crypto you must first consider the funds are gone forever when you first buy. Forget about it for six months and then see how youre doing. Good luck!

I invested nearly 1 lakh and started small trading on Zebpay. And got the very minimal profits like 1K and 2K.

- - How do you track your crypto portfolios?
  - I am very concerned about security so I go with apps that do not require signing up or registration. I also do not use APIs from exchanges.

  - After looking up this guy, it is evident that he is fraudulent. The truth is that NO-ONE can predict where the market will go, and how high any coin will rise. We can use historical charts and compare asset classes to each other but there is no way of truly knowing where Bitcoin, or any cryptocurreny will go. I remain optimistic about cryptocurrencies however there needs to be a sense of realism when investing. Bitcoin has an equal chance of going to 0 as it does to 1M. The Cryptocurrency Bubble 
- - Aside from ETH and Zcash, whats the next big cryptocurrency in 2017?
  - Thank you. If you want to make money in the cryptocurrency sphere, I don’t think it’s worth mining. There are so many cryptocurrencies popping up that it is impossible to stay on top of them all. Instead I recommend approaching it like a venture capitalist does when investing in startups. 
- - If all of the cryptocurrencies are mined and their further supply was stopped then would cryptocurrency trading end?
  - No. First of all, not all crypto are mined, some of it uses other type of algoritms. Well, both projects have solid companies behind them, with infrastructure. If Ethereum collapses, they know who owns the token based on the blockchain of Ethereum. So people would still keep those tokens and they could move to another platform like Neo or Lisk, or even make some centralized structures inside their company to rebuy those token or use them in some other way. 
- - How robust and safe is Tether in the event of cryptocurrency crash?
  - This is just my personal opinion…I would be wary of Tether. Here are some points to consider The coin definitely has some points in the positive column, like identity benefits and time savings, but I would argue the cons are worth serious consideration. Tether puts the crypto community at real risk. Disclaimer I have no position in Tether. I am long ETH, AXP, ETHOS, EOS, NEO, IOTA, STEEM, SALT, CVC.

  - Several mining farms that I know of are based in Iceland. The country offers cheap electricity based on geothermal power I understand electricity costs $0.06 per KWh as against $0.40 in California. The cooler temperatures translate into lower air conditioning costs. And Internet availability is practically at 100%. A lot of mining is also done in China where the mining farms are located in remote, mountainous regions close to hydro-electric sources of power. 
- - What is the most probable cause of a cryptocurrency crash?
  - It’s not that there is a decrease in demand, its for fear of buying right now, as opposed to later when things settle down. Please go and watch my video on the crypto currency crash, for more information on this subject. 1. decrease in demand - less people believing in it’s purpose, less value it has. that means that the supply will increase per person. and we all know that if there is abundant supply but low demand, the price becomes very cheap. 
- - Will we see a third major cryptocurrency, after Bitcoin and Ethereum, in the next 2-3 years?
  - If one take a look how much ICOs we see at the moment, Iam sure, a few of them could be success. If one invest smart, the risk to loose much money is low. But good opportunities for the future 2 to 5 yrs. There are 11 cryptocurrencies plus one asset OmiseGo with market capitalizations over $1 billion today.

Otherwise Bitcoin Cash also might serve the purpose of medium/short term profit. 
- - Has any cryptocurrency started in India, like Bitcoins?
  - India is a young country with a population of 125 Crore of Population. By Young I did not mean that India is 70 years old, but a nation with youth as its biggest strength. This is exactly the same time when China was going through in the years of 1970s and with the same calculation India has huge potential, by the time 2030 is here China would get an average age of 38 years which will let open all the opportunities for India to rise. 
- - Is it late to start mining bitcoins or any other cryptocurrency?

- - Will cryptocurrency hedge funds become a thing?
  - The people who are complaining about BTC volatility don’t recall trading emerging markets in the 90’s or what life is like trading exotic derivatives. Yes, it’s volatile, but that doesn’t really matter. The market cap matters. The services structure matters. Growth of the services eco-system, the ability to borrow, and the breadth of available products matter. Those issues have only ever gone one way. 
- - Which cryptocurrency has the strongest developer backing?
  - I would argue that the Ethereum has the strongest developer backing. It is open source and allows for devs to build apps using its technology. From the website “Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts applications.” They focus on being developer friendly. They allow devs to design tech with the blockchain technology that cyrptocurrencies are built on. But just my opinion. Some may argue there are more dev friendly options. 
- - Can you run a business with only cryptocurrency?
  - Do you mean running a business accepting only crypto as a payment method? Or maybe building it based on blockchain? Sure, you can. But youd be limiting your reach to a relatively small audience. Also, crypto currency is meant to build decentralized services, so you wont be precisely owning everything you make, itll be managed by the whole blockchain. 
- - Isn’t there a fund which invests in cryptocurrencies?
  - If you go with the market cap weighted fund it will be the least volatile, at around 110% annual volatility, lower than single coin investments. The equal weighted one will have a higher volatility, at around 128% annual, but also lower than single coin investments. The reason is that diversification benefits of such a high-volatile asset are very large. You can build your own cryptocurrency index fund and avoid the hefty fees. 
- - What is the next big thing to invest in after cryptocurrency?
  - In the past 18 years of my career, I have tried very unusual things. I like to do either different things or things differently. I cannot breathe inside a frame-box life of 9 to 5. People including my own family say that “I have lost a lot of money doing/ trying crazy things to earn livelihood”. I say “I spent a hell lot of money to learn the GAME OF LIFE”. My mistakes are my best teachers as they have taught me wisdom and enriched my experience.

  - It’s very hard to answer this type of question, because there are many technical and economical factors involved. As a tech guy, i know next to nothing about markets and the economics of cryptocurrencies, so i’ll base my guess mostly on tech aspects. There are a few obvious candidates Those 3 are already “big” so if nothing really catastrophic occurs with any of them, they will keep being big. The newcomers

- - What are the best penny cryptocurrencies for 2018, and how do you buy them?
  - Don’t get ‘Penny’ cryptos confused with penny stocks… Penny cryptocurrencies are not always the ones with the most upside potential, the factor you really need to be looking at is supply and current market cap. All things being equal, the higher the supply, the less valuable the coins is. This is due to the elimination of scarcity, if there is no limit to supply, when demand rapidly increases, price will be inelastic.

Stop supporting and enabling criminals. However I believe this technology is currently evolving and will be our future.

- - Why do hackers ask for payouts in cryptocurrency?
  - I already gave the answer of this question in related questions. Anyways there are several reasons because of which hackers love payments in Bitcoin only.

Your plan is to use it sometime later which you havent planned yet. 
- - What cryptocurrency can I buy below 1 cent that have the potential to grow?
  - I am not a financial adviser and my advise should be taken as an opinion only but do your own research and make an educated guess and you have the potential to make a lot of money. Yikes.

On the other hand, female sex workers regularly face severe public opinion and aggressive behaviour of the clients. 
- - Which cryptocurrency exchange is better, Binance or Coinbase?
  - personally from all the cryptocurrency exchange sites i prefer binance. Trading fees Low trading fees are important for the growth of any exchange. In this regard, Binance is very competitive and only charges 0.1% fee for each trade. Moreover, it should be noted that you can get a discount of 50% if you use their token BNB for trading. The discount is huge and it brings down the overall trading fees to just 0.05% which is one of the lowest in the exchange ecosystem. 
- - How might Bitcoin/cryptocurrency prices crash irreversibly? In what scenarios might value be wiped out?
  - In natural systems, there is such a thing as a complete collapse. For example, there’s a famous case of reindeer that were introduced to a new environment, with few predators, and just kept growing and growing and growing… until total collapse happened. That’s a scary question. If you had just mentioned ‘fall’, ‘drop’ or ‘crash’ it would have been been much easier to answer. 
- - Can cryptocurrency enable a barter-like service economy?
  - Bartsome solves most of the other issues of barter probably as much as it will ever be solved without resorting to “barter bux” and other internal currency-like schemes that are arguably just another currency. So when you say “cryptocurrency”you probably mean BTC and keep in mind, it’s a whole protocol specifically designed around an alternate currency, which again by definition is not really barter.

- - What are the best books for someone interested in cryptocurrency?
  - None. Stay away from the cryptocurrency books. Books do well for evergreen content, and that’s not cryptos. Sure, you can learn a thing or two from such books. For example, what the blockchain technology is or how Bitcoin works etc. Nothing that you can’t learn from the Internet. Crypto books tend to be annoyingly repetitive with a lot of fluff to make up the volume. Whilst you’re going to learn a fair share of information from them, probably half of it will be already outdated or irrelevant. 
- - Why is Crypto-currency innovative from a economic point of view?
  - The term “crypto-currency” is too recently a conceived term and the technology too broad to be addressed simply. A number of “buzzwords” first need to be clarified. “Crypto-currency”- should by definition mean any system with a transferable unit of value, digitally encrypted to trace transaction history and hence ownership. Too often the term is used for any digital representation of money even if no cryptographic algorithm is employed.

This makes them similar to traditional money in that respect, and makes them more “real.” 
- - Lets assume Bitcoin turns out to be a bubble and this bubble bursts. How will this affect other cryptocurrencies? Will their prices drop too?

In a similar metaphorical sense — Bitcoin has momentum.

  - Some of the limitations that cryptocurrencies presently face – such as the fact that one’s digital fortune can be erased by a computer crash, or that a virtual vault may be ransacked by a hacker – may be overcome in time through technological advances. What will be harder to surmount is the basic paradox that bedevils cryptocurrencies – the more popular they become, the more regulation and government scrutiny they are likely to attract, which erodes the fundamental premise for their existence.

- - Nebulas NAS is being touted as a future top 5 cryptocurrency. Is this project the real deal or is the hype machine in overdrive again?

Certain implementations of online wallets are simply web applications with access to wallets running on a full node.

The supply of the coin will change the price of a coin. Fewer coins and a high market cap will seem to have a higher price then a currency with a huge supply at the same market cap. If you find a coin with a reasonably low market cap giving it room to grow and has tech that will disrupt the market you have a winner.

- - Can the creators of a cryptocurrency give themselves a large amount of it?
  - You have to see and check for each cryptocurrency to find it out. For litecoin, it is a fair start to mining for all.

We should see more volatile movements on this chart a month or two after the 1st of August when the actual split happens or not.

  - You are going to have trade-offs that you need to think about when picking an answer. 1. Do you want simply the best returns, or do you want the best risk adjusted returns? 2. How much do you value certainty in you decisions? Probably the top coin for 2018 will be something that it would be impossible for someone at present to predict. It will be something with less than $100 million in market cap right now, but will end 2018 with a 100x return. 
- - Is investing in the right Cryptocurrency more profitable than mining?
  - Right cryptocurrency in the sense of one with good cause, team & motive? Or with high profit? Cause the former may take a lot of time, but it will surely mature with time.

Zcash and it’s forked variants are the best of the “major” altcoins, but there are a lot of small altcoins that often pop up above ZCash profitability for short periods, then get swamped as folks “chase the profitability”.

The market decides their value and as such the tokens can also be kept as an investment in the project being successful over time, in the hope that they increase in value vs bitcoin or other more general currencies such as deCred, Monero etc. They will increase in value when a lot of people use the golem network

  - Ripple remained relatively weak from a long-term technical perspective, as it has been following the segment lower during the correction.

I guess the baove technical indicators might help you in decide.

Other countries following suit on ICO bans. The looming possibility of Segwit2X. The various pump and dump schemes that made the price of Ethereum and Bitcoin rise, CEO of JP Morgan citing bitcoin as “fraud”, or that a correction is due because of the steep rise in price in the recent months. 
- - How likely is it that cryptocurrency will become the monetary value of choice?
  - This is indisputable. as long as there are governments and central banks in this world, the likelihood of this happening is small, but it doesn’t mean it will not have a lot of users.

This is a clear sign that cryptocurrencies will play a role in the future.

They are fantastic breakthroughs, but not yet in some killer apps but in turning the spotlight on the core issues of money and finance.

It is very difficult for a coin to go 50x, especially within a year’s time.

I define this as being in the less than $50 million range, or even sub $10 million.

The short term on the other hand is completely based on bitcoin, and should be treated with ease.

Once their app is released I expect it to go upto 5–10$ a coin by eary to mid next year. Or If you meant a coin with no value I’d say Swiss Coin. It trades for 1 to 3 Satoshis or .00000001 of a Bitcoin. You can’t go any lower. If you buy at that price and it’s goes to 2 Satoshi you’ve doubled your money! But it’s worthless and no one will buy/ sell.

  - I don’t care if people call it the rupee or rupaiyah or whatever name they can come up with. For me, its about the value. Does it have a potential use case that it is aiming to solve. If no, is it faster by orders of magnitude than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Does it have a good team? Are they planning to tie up with any corporations. Does it have a good economic model not the 100 trillion tokens type of model Do they have a roadmap for the next 18 months? Was the ICO done in accordance to SEC rules? Did they have a fair ICO or planning to have one? Unless they have atleast one of these I won’t be putting any money because it becomes a pumper dumper club otherwise.

- - Is it advisable to invest in cryptocurrency? How do I invest from India?
  - Status of crypto currency in India is still grey. Legality is still not granted for the same. Many are lured by quick gains claimed by self proclaimed investors  Ive no evidence to know whether they are right, they could be… or by the glamour attached to this hi tech product. But I would like to address this issue from investment objective point of view. An investor should be careful in investing in financial products of which he is not clear in terms of how it operates it how it generates income, what are the market risks, what affects the demand and supply, etc. Any financial product where the return is not guaranteed as in the case of fixed deposits, PF, etc, the investor is bearing the entire risk about the returns. The more the investor knows about the product, the lesser the risk he is taking. In the event of any change in market condition, demand, supply, competitive scenario which affects the return, he can quickly make mid course correction and mitigate the risk or buy more if he knows the demand is going to increase. This is far more true in case of equities, mutual funds, etc as compared to crypto currency. In addition, the above products have government backing in terms of regulation which reduces the chances of fraud by promoters. In case of crypto currency, since the government regulation is not in place, in case of any fraud, investor is likely to be to fend for himself. Im not discouraging the investment in crypto currency but one should be aware of the risk hes taking. It would be smart to invest a small amount and get some first hand experience before venturing into large scale in this area unless hes OK with losing his lifes saving in one go. Happy and safe investing!

But practically, only if you can generate enough hype and raise our eyebrows with the tech that your coin would offer. Perhaps something similar to what BLOCKCHAIN did.

  - No platform supports it so far, but I am sure it will happen soon. Meanwhile, you can do it manually by scheduling reminders and deploying funds.

Define your own rule of dip say 5 - 8% drop and deploy that month’s investment. 
- - Can a cryptocurrency investment fund be started in India currently or in the near future?

  - No, it’s supply and demand. Cryptocurrencies differ, because they disrupt the current markets. In the long run, until the new balance between old and new is found, the price is up.

- - Which cryptocurrency will become the most useful as a transactional coin to buy goods and services?
  - Unless its protocol drastically improved, none of the existing. In its capacity as an effective medium of exchange a crypto-currency has to meet the following basic set of requirements Due to their decentralized, widely distributed DB architecture, all of popular block-chain technology based digital currencies’ protocols are currently incapable to rise their transactions’ speed over 10–15 records per second. Some, e.g. XRP, claim thousands but it has never been sufficiently proven. 
- - Are there any possibilities that cryptocurrency as a whole is going to crash?
  - Yes, this is definitely a possibility. Though regulation-wise… I think it may be less possible than many think. Cryptocurrencies are global, and are not centralized… and centralized entities themselves banks, governments cannot really control cryptocurrencies without controlling the internet. Many believe it is a ‘bubble’… and, in some ways it is; however, there is a good chance that the actual ‘usability’ of cryptocurrencies will increase at a rate fast enough to prevent the bubble from “crashing”. Basically, if people are purchasing a cryptocurrency simply as an investment… and the majority of people holding the investment are merely investors… this is especially when considering past historical events a bad sign. In the case of bitcoin… I believe that the majority of the recent buying has been by people who see bitcoin as an investment. If bitcoin has no use, then… bitcoin in general would be very risky. However, cryptocurrencies overall are potentially going to make life easier for people in numerous ways, especially once an individual can go and buy their groceries and easily pay via cryptocurrency. The issues I can see in the future are crypto’s dependence on CPU / GPU power, electricity, and the internet. However… credit cards also would not be viable in the case that the electrical grid and / or internet was / were compromised. I believe that, at this point, cryptocurrencies are here to stay. Now, will there be periods of difficulty as issues are worked out? Definitely. For those used to traditional investments, which come with perceived added security due to the fact that they are sponsored by centralized, brick and mortar, entities. Cryptocurrencies are not; and while this may not deter myself or other like-minded individuals, as I’m sure you have already realized… at this point, atleast within my lifetime, I cannot see cryptocurrencies replacing fiat. Hope that helps

- - Is Bitcoin now doomed to fail in 2016 after Mike Hearns exposé?
  - The things that gets me is that the success or failure of bitcoin is generally judged based on the price level. For most business that are involved in Bitcoin apart from the miners maybe the actual value of bitcoin is not that important. As a business, while im still paying my bills in GBP for example, its irrelevant for me if i get paid 1 BTC for my service at £300 each or 300 BTC at £1 each. At the end of the day, to pay my employees and most of my bills, i still need to convert from BTC to fiat.

- - Are whales really that prevalent in the cryptocurrency market?
  - Yes, whales are a real thing. Some people hold so much of one currency that they are literally locked in to it. If they go to sell more that a certain amount the price tanks. Some people who are whales take advantage of this they sell a large amount of currency and buy it back at a lower price. I think the Eth flash crash kind of woke whales up to the fact that they could move the market in a way that devalued their currency severely. 
- - What is the easiest cryptocurrency coin to mine on a regular PC or a laptop using CPU only? And how long it takes to mine a one coin of it?
  - You probably know that there is an engineering challenge in the design of cryptographic proof of work algorithms in making them resistant to specialized hardware. The main strategy currently used in designing of POW scheme for which retail hardware is competitive is to design a hash function whose speed is bound not by CPU speed but by the speed at which a machine can move large amounts of memory. A good example is Ethash, which you can still run profitably on an ordinary GPU.

Technically nothing is 100% secured and there is always a way to crack the code. If you are concerned about the security, use a paper wallet. In Blockchain I trust.

- - Which cryptocurrencys do you believe is most likely to fail and why?
  - An example of a work-in-progress? hmm…my guess will be Reddcoin RDD. Sad to admit this to a lot of people, but RDD no longer has a future. They were on fire at first, the idea was bright using social media as a payment mechanism, but it is a vastly underfunded community team with poor approach & strategy to the problem because the development of RDD took too long to allow newer players with better team and funding e.g. See $KIN & kik enter the crypto space. As they say everyone loves the new guy, so to be most frank and politr, dont waste your time with RDD cos all ur gonna get is organic movement till the community shrinks away. Also see $Elix. All the best. 
- - Which cryptocurrency will give a 500x return in 2018, 19?
  - Be on the lookout for coins or people promising gains that seem to good to be true. If they are making claims that seem to good to be true about future prices they probably are.

The fact is that most DASH is in their masternodes, so the scarcity is really really high. People keep a lot of DASH in their masternodes because they get paid a percentage for keeping it there. But if some decide to dump it, we will have 10 times more DASH on the market.

Also, as the systems are decentralized there are no regulators, which means there is no way a government can stop or block a payment.
