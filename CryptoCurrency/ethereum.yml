Ethereum is different it has its own technology and can be processed quicly, even if Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold are trying to be processed more quickly in the future.

- - Is investing in Ethereum good in 2017?
  - Even though the price of Ethereum has already appreciated significantly in 2017, there is still 10x, maybe even 100x longterm upside from current levels. Ethereum hasn’t come close to mainstream adoption yet, but here are hundreds, possibly thousands of applications in development. Many of these applications are focused on making Ethereum more accessible and user friendly. The world wide web was extremely inaccessible in the early days until Netscape came along and made it much easier for the general public to browse the internet. As the experience of browsing the web became much more accessible, usage exploded. Ethereum hasn’t had it’s “Netscape” yet but it is in development. As these projects come online over the next few years, millions of people will be introduced to Ethereum, and the value will likely eclipse $1000 USD.

- - What will Ethereum be worth in 2018?
  - One thing is sure, ETH will surpass BTC.

- - What are the Achilles heels of Ethereum?
  - Consider a XYZ contractor raises some funds in form of ETH via ICO, some of the ETH will be liquidated to pay for the development of project but contractors also see the rising price of ETH.

  - I believe Bitcoin will reach near $100,000 late 2018 / early 2019 and then the bubble will pop. I dont believe any of these currencies will be around longer than 2025. The reason for this is that a fortune 500 company will most likely develop their own coin which will be most secure, trusted and respected globally. My hypothesis is that we will eventually only have one currency that is used globally, this may seem irrational but blockchain allows us to do this. Thanks for reading, Devin

  - While I do not have a crystal ball with which I can look into the future, there are at least three Blockchain which are showing potential to replace Ethereum in the long term. The first of those Blockchain is NEO. Launched at the end of 2016, it an open source platform like Ethereum. The similarities stop right there as NEO aims to build smart economy whereas the goal of Ethereum is to build an economy which is more globally accessible one official description. 
- - Is Lisk going to compete with Ethereum?
  - Yes. Ethereum stores state of all contracts in a single blockchain. This is conceptually nice and convenient, but its not scalable. If you are running an Ethereum node, youll have to process logic of all apps using Ethereum and store all of their data on your computer. Also it might be not costeffective. If many apps will compete for scarce block space and it has to be scarce for people to be able to run Ethereum nodes, only highestbidders will be able to use it. 
- - Is Ethereum mining profitable in India?
  - Current Block time 16.89s Current Block Reward 5ETH This means you will have to buy 100 1050Ti cards costing you around $20000 plus electricity cost.

- - Ethereum has more use cases than Bitcoin in my opinion. Even the Bitcoin is the grandfather of crypto. Could Ethereum outpace it? Perhaps a better question is, do you think Ethereum is undervalued given its incredibly practical technology?
  - I definitely agree with you. I don’t know as Ether is “undervalued” per se… however, I think its value is more truthful. Bitcoin has a lot of interest; however, as you say, Ethereum in several ways is more “usable” than Bitcoin. I hardly transact in bitcoin, mostly due to the delays and high fees. There are more “buy and hold” users of Bitcoin, as compared to ether. Ether is being treated more like an actual currency, as opposed to a digital commodity, at least in the U.S. However, with the upandcoming features expected to be integrated into the Bitcoin blockchain in Q1 2018… I suspect bitcoin has an eye on ethereum and doesn’t want to be upstaged. Right now, ether seems more viable longterm; however, this could change. Personally, like you, I favor ether and have been a supporter since the beginning. Due to the power consumption of the bitcoin network, the delays, and the high fees one of my transactions cost over $8.00, couldn’t really get around it at the time so I had to pay it, I don’t really use Bitcoin. I bought in at around 750, 3800, and again several weeks back when it dipped; however, I was never a longterm holder and to be honest I’ve favored the ethereum blockchain for quite a time now. Now, I did back off for a while… many of the ICOs many of which are hosted on the ethereum blockchain coming out just seemed overhyped and a lot of people were getting scammed. I don’t really do ICOs and I got a little tired of all of the deception going on and I thought it would damage the reputation of ethereum as a whole. However, there is more accountability in the previous weeks and sort of a “cleaning out” of bad ICOs going on. I think the recent upsurge in ether’s value in the past two weeks points to this; additionally, a higher proportion of ETH users will likely start to buy and hold ethereum; and this will also likely drive the value higher. I can definitely see ETH matching the values in terms of fiatequivalent of DASH and maybe even Bitcoin Cash, in 2018. Many will tell you that Ethereum will outpace Bitcoin in the next several months… I would rather tell you something that will probably happen as opposed to something that could happen… anything can happen. Best of luck to you sir  
- - Is it a good time to mine Ethereum?
  - The reason I am asking this, is because Ethereum reached 0,05 bitcoin this week. That is the same amount as in May earlier this year. With all the speculation of Bitcoin dropping under $5000 before the end of the year and the amount of ICO’s launched on Ethereum, it seems like Ethereum has to go up against Bitcoin, so it has to be making profit in the next few months. I understand that the gasprice of Ethereum has much influence for the miners and the gasprice has been all over the place, so is it a booming business or is Ethereum already done? Doesn’t seem like that to me. 
- - What are the advantages of Ethereum over Bitcoin?
  - Still, the question about whether Ethereum can overtake Bitcoin at some point is a fierce debate which I think will continue to develop more in the year 2018. If you want to find out more about the advantages Ethereum has you can check these links below https//www.dcforecasts.com/ 
- - Is ethereum in a bubble?
  - No Ethereum is not a bubble. Ethereum is a blockchain based platform for smart contracts. Meaning you can create a company or any blockchain based software and deploy it using Ethereum.

On 23 January 2014, Vitalik announced the start of Ethereum project on the Bitcointalk forum. Vitalik Buterin, a 23 year old at time of writing Russian chap who grew up in Canada. I would tell you more but, in honesty, Google will do it far better than I. 
- - Is Ripple XRP the next Ethereum?
  - No, it doesn’t do the same things as Ethereum does. Ripple is positioning itself to be the top blockchain for managing banking transactions. Their design is very targeted for managing transactions between large financial institutions. This does not mean that Ripple is not solving a real problem, just that it’s not competing with Ethereum. in my opinion this digital currency is the future  
- - Whats the reasoning behind the exponential increase in value for Bitcoin and Ethereum in April/May 2017?
  - Why it’s happening now, I can’t answer. You don’t know which snowflake caused the avalanche. What we can say though is that making it easier to purchase cryptocurrency combined with good press and understanding made an opening for something like this to happen. And we’re not even close to done yet. 
- - Should I invest in Ethereum or Golem, and why?
  - And what a fight it will be! Ladies and gentlemen, the fight of the hour Ethereum vs. Golem! If you’d like to see the answer then check out my channel All Coins Considered Right. The fight of the hour. Ethereum is the heavy weight champion favored to win. A large crowd cheers Ethereum on — and each cheer bolsters this fighter’s strength. The future looks bright for Ethereum too. A long career with many possibilities ICO’s being only the first such possibility. 
- - Which will last longer -- Bitcoin or Ethereum, and why?
  - Question “Which will last longer, Bitcoin or Ethereum, and Why ?” I strongly believe that Ethereum would outlast Bitcoin in an ideal scenario although “The Bitcoin hype” fairly may never end. Any currency is only as strong as the community using it. Factors that do Affect the growth of cryptocurrency Hope this Helped. Do let me know if you have any further Questions. Cheers! Ethereum 
- - The Ethereum Protocol Upgrade Hard Fork is to occur in September 2017. What will happen to Ethereums price?
  - Same thing as traffic for the 2017 Solar Eclipse… Allow me to explain… I live in Oregon. For the 2017 Solar Eclipse we received over 1 million visitors over the weekend…all in anticipation for this sensational solar event. What was traffic like? The days before August 21st it was heavier than usual but not intense. People were flying in, excited and fascinated by this rare event. They made their way to their camps and hotels little by little over the weekend. 
- - Is Ethereum going to reach the value of Bitcoin?
  - I think Ethereum is the best coin and should be more valuable than bitcoin in the long term. Ethereum is the cryptocurrency with the most potential. It is in fact a revolution with a lots of crazy applications. It allows something called “smart contracts”. A smart contract is not a simple transaction, but an arbitrary piece of code. This allows the creation of an unlimited numbers of applications. 
- - With $1000, is it better to invest in Ethereum, Litecoin or Neo?
  - From a risk perspective, Ethereum and Litecoin are a lot less risky comparatively than Neo. Litecoin has been around since 2011 and has a strong community. Ethereum has been around since 2015 and has become the defacto platform for decentralized applications. 
- - What is Ethereum? What is the difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin? Is it recommended to invest in Ethereum?
  - Ethereum is an open source distributed public blockchain network. It allows decentralized apps to be built on it with the help of Smart Contract functionality. 
- - Should I sell all Bitcoin and buy Ethereum now? Is it too late to buy Ethereum?
  - I am much more supportive of Bitcoin, even though at first glance it would seem that Bitcoin has even less value than Ethereum as the latter at least provides infrastructure to build and run apps. The reason is that the world needs a nationless, reliable, practical, secure, and convenient way to protect money from inflation of fiat currencies which are manipulated by central banks so called store of value function. Currently, gold kind of serves that function, but gold is not ideal, since you have to pay to store it in a a safe. A crypto currency is a much more convenient way to store value assuming there is only one chosen by the whole world for this purpose maybe 2–3 at most, but certainly not tens or hundreds 
- - What is being developed to replace ethereum?
  - Its very comparable to Ethereum, acting as a decentralized peertopeer network. It allows individual investors to take part in decentralized financial exchanges and like Ethereum, the token can be used for raising equity or crowdfunding. NEO plans to tackle many of the scaling issues that tripped up Ethereum, resulting in the loss of confidence by many investors. Handling these issues before massive market exposure will be very positive for the digital currency in the future. 
- - Will ethereum rise to over $1500 in 5 years?
  - Yes. If bitcoin is a pocket calculator then Ethereum is like a smartphone. There are plenty of companies that are building dApps on top of it decentralised applications. The potential for this blockchain is literally unlimited with the number of efficiencies it can bring to global industry. 
- - Should I convert my only bitcoin to Ethereum? Considering there will be huge events for Ethereum for the months ahead.
  - Even though Ethereum is positioning itself to become a large platform, the fact that Bitcoin is so well known makes it the first place where people invest. This is a graph of the number of google searches for the terms Bitcoin vs other common terms. Ethereum is starting to get noticeable traction, but Bitcoin is still the most well known by far. So you may make a better return with Ethereum in the next few months, but Bitcoin still seems to be a solid investment in the future. 
- - What will be the Ethereum price by 2020?
  - Here the chart of Number of Transaction on Ethereum Blockchain Per Sec As you can see from chart above, Bitcoin was experiencing rapid growth until the beginning of 2017. The following chart of the Bitcoin mempool will explain why the growth has flatlined. Note that this or any other predictions can not be perceived as a constant. All important events are random, they can not be predicted or taken into account. The further the forecast is given the less chance that it will come true. 
- - Is mining Ethereum profitable? How much Ethereum could I realistically mine in one month?
  - It depends on the power and the hash rate of your miner. There are certain factors that you should make sure are right, which will eventually lead to better mining and will benefit you in the long run. If you want to know how much you can make mining Etherum, read the following article. Tips for better mining You can also try free Ethereum mining. Points to remember for better profits joining mining. There you can learn anything about Ethereum. 
- - What is the predicted rate for Ethereum at the end of 2017?
  - However, ETH is perceived as one of more “stable crypto’s” like BTC, mainly because it is surrounded by talented communities of developers that are actively engaging in creating value on the platform. 
- - So many altcoins claim to be better than Ethereum, NEO, EOS, NEM, etc. Does Ethereum still have a good future? Why?
  - The thing that make Ethereum great is not the technology alone, but the network of developers and projects now supporting the Ethereum platform. While other platforms have different and, arguably, better ways of handling certain parts of the stack, the truth is that 90% of developers and businesses building new blockchain applications are going to do it on the Ethereum platform. 
- - Is it safe to leave Ethereum coins in Coinbase?
  - No. Considering this happened; Cryptsy CEO Stole Millions From Exchange, Court Receiver Alleges  CoinDesk this; Behind the Biggest Bitcoin Heist in History Inside the Implosion of Mt. Gox And this; The Bitfinex Bitcoin Hack What We Know And Dont Know  CoinDesk Coinbase also has their own problems. Most recently; How to lose $8k worth of bitcoin in 15 minutes with Verizon and Coinbase.com 
- - When is Ethereum projected to reach $5000?
  - It really boils down to supply and demand, because at the end of the day we do not have a crystal ball! If your looking to invest into Ethereum as an investment you cant simply rely of the upside potential you really have to look at the downside risks. We have prepared a analysis of Ethereum to be used as Context. If you were to invest at current prices of 1000US say, but you know it has had bad runs where it has lost 50–70% of value then you must assume that as worse case scenairo. 
- - What is the difference between Ethereum and Hyperledger?
  - Hyperledger vs. Ethereum A comparison probably can be made between Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric one amongst the many Hyper ledger project. On the other hand, Fabric has a very modular architecture and provides a lot of flexibility in terms of what you want to use and what you don’t. It’s pretty much ala carte and is targeted at businesses wanting to streamline their process by leveraging blockchain technology. 
- - Which software is the best now for Ethereum mining?
  - The programming piece of Eth mining can be pretty tough if you are new to Linux or programming in general. I just copy and paste code and things get kind of tough. You also have brand new GPUs which is another level of challenge, because support for these new GPUs has not really happened yet. I have had excellent luck with eth os, from GPU shack. If you don’t want to do thatI would encourage you to look into running a Ubuntu system and probably look at the Eth/Decred miner. 
- - What is the best Ethereum Wallet to store ERC20 tokens in?
  - Ill recommend you MyEtherWallet.com · Your Key to Ethereum MyEtherWallet gives you the ability to generate new wallets so you can store your Ether yourself, not on an exchange. This process happens entirely on your computer, not the servers. Therefore, when you generate a new wallet, you are responsible for safely backing it up. 
- - What are the prerequisites for learning Ethereum, Solidity, smart contracts, and Dapps?
  - If you understand basic web development tools, such as Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Node.js, you can learn to build Dapps. It’s a fairly even playing field because the concepts are new to everyone, even people with 10+ years of experience. You will have to learn some new computer science concepts related to encryption, hashes, etc. They aren’t difficult to learn, but it takes time and persistence. 
- - Is NEM the new Ethereum?
  - I wouldn’t compare them directly like that. I just spend a good 2 days reading up on NEM and why its a good investments and came up with the following points Also, I got these things to say after reading the white paper, watching videos and asking questions on Reddit’s communities. Ease of use for developers NEM offers an amazing API that allows for any programming language to be used providing all programmers with the ability of develope on NEM with the language they are most confident with. 
- - When will Zebpay be introducing Ethereum and IOTA?
  - It is better to buy these coins at international price so you can sell them at a relatively higher price than what zebpay will offer. 
- - What merchants accept ethereum?
  - Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum still has no list of merchants that accept it. I doubt you can find a shop restaurant or grocery in any city that accepts ethers. If you have heard of any, please let me know because my business is about getting shops to accept ethers, and if there’s a shop in your city already doing it, I’d like to know how they’re doing it. 
- - Bitcoin or Ethereum? Which one will become more successful?
  - Bitcoin vs Ethereum Which is a better option? It is also important to note that Bitcoin and Ethereum are relatively distinct. Whereas Bitcoin is more of a digital gold and a medium of payment, Ethereum has a few nifty features that give it an edge over its predecessor in some key areas. So what really does the future hold? Only time will tell. 
- - Should I mine Ethereum or Ethereum Classic?
  - Both the Ethereums are good to mine. It all depends on the hashrate of the mining rig and the Ethereum pool you join. To learn about Ethereum mining and its profits read the following How Much Can You Make Mining Ethereum  Beginners Guide Also it is wise idea to invest and buy Ethereum classic. Ethereum classic is valued a little low, which makes it easy for people to buy and trade it for profits. 
- - Will Lisk be more profitable than Ethereum?
  - Oh, it’s possible. Consider these aspects of Lisk Lisk is also currently involved in an ambitious rebranding process that will nodoubt help the platform. Yes, Ethereum does have the firstmover and networkeffect advantages, but that doesn’t necessarily translate to longterm value. So much of it’s current “value” is speculative. Remember AOL, anyone? Just my 2 cents! Feel free to disagree/expand in the comments or via a new answer. 
- - Is it right to invest in Ethereum?
  - Ethereum blockchain is controlled by a small group of insiders that can and do edit the blockchain. This was demonstrated by the June 18th, 2016 “DAO debacle” that led to a “hard fork”. Ethereum is innovative in it’s ability to perform secure “smart contracts” but it possesses neither of the two characteristics that would make it a “cryptocurrency” or a good investment vehicle. its a very wise choice to do so , as even microsoft stated they are going to work with it ! 
- - Is the Ethereum unlimited?
  - Ether, the currency native to the Ethereum blockchain, does not have a hard cap. However, with the further developments in Ethereums push towards becoming a full Proof of Stake protocol and as more apps and transactions occur on the network, the generation of new Ether, which acts like gas and is burned during transactions and development, is expected to level off and reach equilibrium. Meaning that essentially a soft cap exists when the burn rate matches the generation rate. 
- - Could Ethereum reach $3,000 by the end of 2018?
  - During the past couple of years, cryptocurrencies have garnered the attention of every investor, especially after the meteoric rise of currencies like Bitcoin and the Ether. Keep in mind, to reach $2,000 it should have a market cap of 200 billions. It can go even in a single day to $2,000. Thats my prediction. 
- - How does Ethereum Mining Work?
  - Ethereum is an open source, decentralized software platform or stage. Ethereum mining can be done by using CPU or GPU on selfcomputer. Here is a basic overview of the steps required Generally Cloud mining is managing the preexisting mining facilities via service provider. It is an ideal option for those people who are beginners in this industry and cannot afford to have their own mining rig or equipment. 
- - How do I get started with ethereum mining?
  - There are so many ways to mining Ethereum, but I would like to recommend the best and safest, especially for beginners. I recommend using Cloud Mining Services like Hashflare.io Unlike bitcoin, powerful and fast ethereum ASICs aren’t available right now. Installing the software After selecting some mining hardware, the next step is to install the mining software. First off, miners need to install a client to connect to the network. 
- - Will Ethereum reach $1000 any time soon?
  - Ethereum surely has a great potential to go above and beyond Bitcoin in terms of their market cap. Mining ether tokens are cheaper. Less electricity is used for mining, it is also stronger and has a lot of other alternatives to choose from rather than just making simple financial transactions. 
- - Is the Ethereum hard fork in January a scam?
  - This is not an investment advice. Footnotes Ever since the Bitcoin hard fork has gifted Bitcoin holders essentially ‘free’ Bitcoin Cash, hard forks have been a hotter topic of discussion with a surge in public interest. Scammers are not about to be left far behind, are they? It looks like it. But fortunately, it looks like the ‘developers’ behind this have decided to cancel the hardfork given that no one is taking them seriously. https//bitcointalk.org/index.ph... 
- - Everyone keeps talking about ethereum as the next bitcoin, what makes ethereum highly potential of increasing in value?
  - Ethereum was developed to augment and improve on bitcoin, expanding its capabilities. Importantly, it was developed to feature prominently “smart contracts” decentralized, selfexecuting agreements coded into the blockchain itself. Ethereum was first proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and went live with its first beta version in 2015. Its blockchain is built with a turingcomplete scripting language that can simultaneously run such smart contracts across all nodes and achieve verifiable consensus without the need for a trusted third party such as a court, judge or legal system. According to its website, Ethereum can be used to “codify, decentralize, secure and trade just about anything.” In late 2014, Ethereum raised over $18 million in bitcoin by way of a crowd sale to fund its development. 
- - What are all the ways Ethereum is worse than Bitcoin?
  - Vitalik and the ability to influence him are both existential threats to Ethereum. Everyone admits its a benevolent dictatorship there. Although many devs use and like Ethereum, no one has talked about what would happen if something happened to Vitalik. If he got hit by a bus, or worse, kidnapped and ransomed no one knows if the platform could survive it in its current state. I hate to sound so morbid but it’s a risk that should be considered. 
- - Is Russia keen on Ethereum? Why?
  - “Russia” may mean many things, but let’s assume it’s about the people of Russia and the Russian authorities. As for the Russian government, there are two reasons to examine a blockchain solution, and a smart contract platform like Ethereum specifically. Is the Russian establishment keen on Ethereum? We don’t know, but they do take the blockchain seriously as it may solve some of their most serious issues. Smart contracts… Imagine a replacement for cash that can be programed… 
- - What are the main differences between Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero and Ripple?
  - You did some great research here, because the five cryptocurrencies you mentioned all nicely correlate with the major value drives in the industry today. Bitcoin Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency, and was released as opensource software in 2009. Using a new distributed ledger known as the blockchain, the Bitcoin protocol allows for users to make peertopeer transactions using digital currency while avoiding the double spending problem. 
- - Will Ethereum and Litecoin follow Bitcoin’s success?
  - Honestly, I don’t think any cryptocurrency will see the same amount of success as Bitcoin. However, I think Ethereum will be close. Let me start with Litecoin, though. In my opinion, Litecoin will always be second fiddle to Bitcoin. Even Litecoin creator Charlie Lee has stated on numerous occasions that he believes Litecoin to be complementary to Bitcoin. Therefore, Litecoin will only grow as Bitcoin grows. 
- - Is it possible that Ethereum will reach $10000 in 10 years?
  - Nobody has any idea of the evolution of the price of Ethereum. Personally, I think Ethereum is the cryptocurrency with the most potential. And $10k in 10 years is possible. In fact, $10k in 2–3 years is possible. Smart contracts are a true killer feature. Something that can change the world. Nobody has any idea of all the possible applications of a such disruptive technology. We have seen p2p loans, digital decentralized autonomous organization DAO, and ICOs, but it is only the beginning. 
- - Is Ethereum valid in India?
  - Its a misconception most people have in India. Guys similar to Bitcoin, ethereum is also a cryptocurrency which has some different protocols than bitcoin but works on the same technology”Blockchain”. I think this misconception is due to fact there is no Indian Exchange is currently putting Ethereum on their platform. Ether and BitCoin are not illegal in India. They aren’t regulated either. They are valid in the sense that they are worth the money it holds. 
- - Should you just buy and hold Bitcoin, Ethereum or other cryptocurrencies?
  - I honestly think that there will be a huge amount of people who don’t believe in banks having money stored in crypto currecies. Also, geeks and others for dozens of different reasons. Then, more and more businesses will accept cryptocurrencies, because the fees are way lower than with Mastercard/VISA/etc. Actually, this is one of the main reasons why the cryptocurrency concept should be sustainable. 
- - Why is Ethereum going down again?
  - To cut a long story short 
- - What is the best and quickest way to buy Ethereum in India?
  - It’s great that you have shown interest in Ethereum, which along with bitcoin leads the blockchain based cryptocurrency and tokens ecosystem. I hope you have done your research and are not investing on speculation and understand the risks. 1. Buy Bitcoin at Zebpay App / Unocoin. 2. Create an account on reputed International Exchanges  Bittrex / Bitfinex  3. Send Bitcoins to the exchange.  Bittrex / Bitfinex  4. Buy Ethereum  Or any other Token of your Interest  
- - Is Ethereum going to grow as big as Bitcoin by 2022?
  - Yes. Even though these two coins are completely different and have different goals, I’m sure Ethereum will be as big as Bitcoin in the near future if not bigger. I’m talking about the market cap, daily volume, price and popularity. I like to use this analogy when it comes to comparing these two 
- - Should I invest in Ethereum classic?
  - Great news for Ethereum Classic enthusiasts. BTCC, the two es biggest platform for trading Bitcoin in China, announced that it Ethereum Classic will integrate its platform. Ethereum Classic originated from a hard fork with the Ethereum network to hack a hacker. But it turned out completely different. 
- - Is Ethereum a good buy for 2018 or any good ICO out there?
  - Yes and no. If you have enough investment capital, why not diversify? Just buy a few Ethereum tokens, and invest the rest in some promising ICO projects. Here’s a review article about ImageProtect ICO Global Coin Report Image Protect Token Sale Review Like I mentioned earlier, Image Protect has been in business for over 3 years now and already has more than 450,000 customers, so for me I think this makes a less risky investment than other ICOs. 
- - What do you think is better to invest in about 10K - Bitcoin or Ethereum?
  - I don’t know, but I personally think that bitcoin offers better gain/risk value. I had Ethereum and sold it during the recent rise in price actually way too early… 
- - Why do Bitcoin and Ethereum crash every January?
  - It is difficult to pin down any factors with any reasonable certainty. Here’s my best guess Bitcoin and Ethereum crash every January because of a combination of profit taking, Christmas/New Years spending. I also assume a lot of Chinese investors that got in are selling in anticipation for Chinese New Year. This is significant because people literally give out cash in hongbao, so they need cash. 
- - Is ethereum overvalued?
  - I would rather ask if it is overhyped or not. Because this is the hidden reason for the price to move in the crypto. It is moving up, up and up through some worries, concerns and troubles like Bitcoin is doing the last years and then suddenly enters the heaven of praise and hype. Where the top is build, price drops often crashes, depression, worries and concerns come back. Cycle repeats. 
- - What should I buy in India, Ethereum, Litecoin or Ripple?
  - Its really depends upon your Goal of Investment and what type of investment you want to go for. i will suggest you to keep yourself updated with crypto market news, trends and gather some insight of cryptocurrencies, if you are new. Well, I cannot advise you on particularly which coin to buy, but surely I can help you out. Ethereum Litecoin Ripple I hope you make a wise decision. Upvote if you like! 
- - When will Ethereum overtake Bitcoin?
  - All of the answers you will receive will be speculation and personal opinion. There is no way knowing for sure. My opinion is that Ether will never be valued as high as Bitcoin. Bitcoin was developed as a store of value. It is meant first and foremost to be used as a currency, and that is what it is good at. People know Bitcoin to be the definition of a blockchain as correct or incorrect as that maybe, and when they go to invest in cryptocurrencies, they think about Bitcoin first. 
- - Can Ethereum reach $6000 by the end of 2018?
  - First, I own ETH and other cryptocurrencies. Crypto currencies market is growing fast and is highly unpredictable. However, some facts make me believe it could I agree that the amount of money required to re iterate this performance is huge but… These are pro that make me believe it’s not impossible. BTC will reach 10k soon and started under a cent. This is hard to believe but this is what’s happening here. 
- - What exactly is Ethereum?
  - Ethereum is the OS for human money. Contrast with the currency money of ants, bees, birds and trees. This is best answered by more unasked questions and answers. First let’s fortify the question. A 1–3 hours A How many minutes/hours of work per day do birds have to allocate for food, shelter, security, selfdevelopment, sex, governance, healthcare, old age savings and entertainment? Contrast the pie chart with that for himans. Q What is money/currency? 
- - Where can I learn solidity ethereum?
  - Today, learning solidity is a bit difficult, particularly if you’re completely new to the Ethereum ecosystem. Six months ago there were almost no good resources on learning outside of the documentation. However, the ecosystem is beginning to improve and offering a lot of methods to learn, based on your preference Next week, I plan on producing a video on how to get started with development and plan on posting it here. Why? Read on.. How can I start with Blockchain development? 
- - Is there a limit to the supply of Ethereum?
  - Quote from Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum Foundation So here is a thought. Currently, because of the PoW ice age, the block time is scheduled to start increasing in mid2017, and past around 2019 the increase is going to grow exponentially. The mining reward does NOT increase proportionately. Hence, there is already an exponential slowdown in the growth of the ETH supply built into the protocol; my script shows Hence, in the foreseeable future, the supply will not go far above 100 million. 
- - Is Bitcoin or Ethereum the projected winner of the market as of 2017?
  - We can compare Ethereum to Bitcoin in the following charts Ethereum Transaction Growth Chart There were 162k transactions on the Ethereum blockchain on 5/19/2017. Here is a chart of the confirmed transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. Confirmed Transactions Per Day Which chart looks more bullish? As you can see from chart above, Bitcoin was experiencing rapid growth until the beginning of 2017. The following chart of the Bitcoin mempool will explain why the growth has flatlined. Mempool Size 
- - Why is Bitcoin increasing in value, but not Ethereum in the recent past?
  - One way of answering this question is checking on the properties of the two cryptocoins. Unlike, Ethereum, Bitcoin is only limited to 21 million coins, and once miners have unlocked all the coins, the planet supply will essentially tap out, unless Bitcoins protocol is changed to allow for a larger supply. Therefore, the coin is considered as a store of value, more or less like gold and hence the fear of missing out has led to the Bitcoin craze. 
- - Is it safer to buy bitcoin or ethereum?
  - The coin is not the issue, it’s you… let me explain lol Anyone who states that investing in cryptocurrencies is easy has most likely missed out on fundamental security measures that are needed to safely secure and store your cryptocurrencies. The combination of the infancy of blockchain technology and the fear of missing out FOMO has led to scams, phishing, hackers and companies with fraudulent intentions flooding the market, and they are very clever in their strategies. 
- - What is going on with Ethereum? Why has it fallen and not recovered?
  - My thoughts about Ethereum changed completely at a certain phase of my ongoing research about this cryptoasset. I have spent more than 100 hours on Ethereum, IPFS etc. and here are the facts which make me believe this freefall will continue and it will reach at least 220 USD. As a result of all this dat, I have not only sold all of the Ethereum I have, I also opened a short position on my broker. 
- - Is Ethereum a good investment when looking at Bitcoins current price range?
  - Ethereum has been doing the right things, consistently for the past 10 months. With the hard fork to metropolis, making way for both Raiden and Proof of Stake, it seems that the platform is priming itself for massive adoption. 
- - What will be the next cryptocurrency to overtake Ethereum?
  - I think, It’s likely to be Ripple XRP that will overtake Ethereum or any other cryptocurrency in the upcoming days. 
- - People keep saying NEO/Antshares is the Chinese Ethereum. Why is Ethereum not the Chinese Ethereum? That is, why does Ethereum not simply occupy that market space? What is so special about NEO that it has a supreme advantage over Ethereum in China?
  - People keep saying NEO is the Chinese Ethereum, but even the NEO team doesnt like that analogy. The truth is that most of the documentation is in Mandarin Chinese, so most of the specifics cant be read by most Westerners. So for all we know, its apples and oranges. 
- - What is the max price for Ethereum?
  - These currencies are extremely volatile as they lack intrinsic value. They are not pegg to any assets. its a matter of demand and supply. Your one stop news and guide to all things crypto. Stay updated with all current crypto news and learn through our array of articles which will definitely keep you occupied. Grow your knowledge, stay relevant. 
- - Is it worth investing in Ethereum? Will it explode like Bitcoin?
  - Yes, it is worth investing in Ethereum and No, it is not going to explode like Bitcoin. It means that while it might make you money in the long term, the ridiculous amount of cash which Bitcoin helped its holders collect back in its heyday won’t be replicated by Ethereum. Why is it so? Well, my mind has churned out the following reason to support my viewpoint Crypto Market Is Stabilizing 
- - Is the crypytocurrency Ethereum going to be the next Bitcoin in terms of growth?
  - When we talk about growth, there are two areas that we could look at  in terms of adoption rate, and capital appreciation. Ethereum has a smart contract feature that could see it having wider realworld applications in the future, and this could maybe allow it to overtake Bitcoin in terms of adoption growth some time in the future. 
- - Whats the future of cryptocurrency Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum?
  - Nobody knows and everyone who claims to know is a lier. It’s the same with the stock marketyou maybe think that this is a promising product but it could fail even though it is the best thing out there. “There are no bad ideas, only bad timings” But let’s not reason through analogy but through first principles. So Bitcoin could be the solution but who knows. Yeah, nobody. 
- - How much have you invested in Ethereum?
  - Imagine a mogul who has put a few billions of dollars into it and sees the sudden growth of value and then he of course decides to cash out on time and reap profits. This logically immediately affects the market capitalization and can burn down your savings. This is why the biggest problem of cryptocurrencies, I can confidently say, is that everybody is looking at them as an investment tool. 
- - Would you rather own Ethereum or Bitcoin?
  - I will divide my investment in both. Bitcoin and Ethereum have different use cases. Bitcoin is a currency whereas Ethereum is computational network. Bitcoin is used as money. Its sole purpose is to be safe and secure. Ethereum is far behind Bitcoin. Ethereum is platform to run your smart contracts. It gave power to people to launch their own tokens, crowdfunding campaigns and organisations. 
- - Where will we see both Ethereum and Ripple by 2025?

  - Totally depends on your situation, what country you are in, if you sold/traded the coins or just held them, etc. In most countries, if you cash out your gains by converting it to fiat then you would need to pay direct taxes income tax.

The secret is that only a small percentage of mined bitcoins is in circulation at the moment, which makes such a disbalance in the supply/demand relations. 
- - Is it better to buy $1,000 of Ethereum or Litecoin?
  - That completely depends on your investment goal. As far as risk premium goes, ETH and LTC are very similar. They’re both among the most mainstream of crypto coins. ETH is a platform used to develop decentralized applications DAPs that enable the seamless exchange of value between two parties. This is very different than LTC or BTC. 
- - Why do big companies like Microsoft and Intel form blockchain alliances around Ethereum and not bitcoin?
  - Your question does not make sense. They have no need. Bitcoin is an actual currency! Blockchain just supports it. Ethereum or Ether is based on and around the software aspect of this called ‘blockchain’ Some A.I. companies are going to start adopting blockchain in their technologies. YES! This will be huge and intergrate them. I have been talking to a clearing house that told me to look for this. 
- - What is the future of money, Bitcoin or Ethereum?
  - Someone said none. I would say both. They serve 2 different purposes so they can both be money. Ethereum has a goal to become a universe for itself  anything you can imagine can be coded in smart contracts and executed while being powered through ETH as gas. Communication between alll those robots and AI machines could actually be powered by ETH. Bitcoin however, tends to become digital gold, store of value and perhaps world’s reserve currency that will be moved not so often and in higher volumes. 
- - What was the price of Ether on Ethereum presale?
  - Hi David, If memory serves 1 Bitcoin entitled the contributor to 2000 Ethers. At the time I think Bitcoin was somewhere between $600 $800. I have since heard people mentioning that 1 Ether at the ICO July 2014 was something like 35–40 cents. As of writing this answer it currently stands at $243. Therefore this would have provided those who bought in at the ICO with a fantastic return in the 3 years that have passed. Now where’s that time machine!  
- - What are some good blogs on Ethereum and blockchain technologies?
  - The technology is moving ahead so quickly it is sometimes very hard to stay up to date. Be warned once you start going down the rabbit hole you may never come back… Hope these help  be warned many can tend to get technical pretty technical  especially many of the podcasts  where the hosts interview CEO and CTO’s from those within the Blockchain space. Enjoy Tim Lea Popular News Sites/Blogs CoinDesk http//www.coindesk.com/ Cointelegraph Cointelegraph.com newsBTC http//newsbtc.com/ CryptocoinsNews

- - Is Ethereum still worth buying after such a huge crash?
  - Is Ethereum still worth buying after such a huge crash? This is a very amateurish way of phrasing this question, and if you get annoyed by me saying this, then I have accomplished my mission because I’d rather you realize how weak think this is and avoid you to play this as a game and lose money, instead of you banging the keys randomly. Do not trade if you don’t know what you’re doing. Then… Your return is a function of the price you pay. The lower you can pay, the higher your potential upside. 
- - Has Ethereum lost its sheen as the number 2 cryptocurrency? Why is it on the decline?
  - Therefore, if anything, Ether hasn’t lost its sheen as the number 2 cryptocurrency but is making headway to reach the level which it attained back in December last year. A mere glance at how the crypto market is doing – hint it is doing well! – tells me that in the near future there could be a bump in the price of Ether yet again. I guess that the previous paragraphs should answer the second portion of your question as well. That is, Ether is NOT on the decline but is going up once again. 
- - What are some interesting statistics on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and other cryptocurrencies?
  - Did you ever thought that if you had invested some money in this new field of ‘cryptocurrencies’ you could have the chance of becoming filthy rich ! May be this is the biggest opportunity that you , me have lost to amass huge amount of wealth. Bitcoin was launched on 17/7/2010 and at that time  1 BTC= $ 0.04951 and now 1 BTC=$13590.47 1 ETC=$3 now 1 ETC=$752.09 You could be in the top 2.01%richest people in the world . 1 IOTA=$0.587 and now 1 IOTA= $3.59 
- - What will be the future of bitcoin after the Ethereum project?
  - I doubt that there is any other cryptocurrency or altcoin that can supersede the bitcoin. At least not for the next 510 years. Of course there are many rising competitors like ripple and litecoin. The newest addition to the list of its competitors is Ethereum. Ethereum has launched its own cryptocurrency called Ether that showed an exceptional growth last year making it the 2nd most popular cryptocurrency of 2016. And for all one knows, Ether is the only currency right now that owns a slight possibility to outpass the bitcoin in a long run. 
- - Is Hyperledger better than Ethereum?
  - To my knowledge, HyperLedger is yet under heavy development and we are yet to see its first major release. However, there are some points to consider when comparing them. Both platforms target different use cases. HL aims at corporate applications, unlikely to be deployed as a public blockchain, while Ethereum is currently deployable as a private blockchain and users can already start using and developing for its popular public blockchain. 
- - Why hasnt Ethereum recovered?
  - There are better altcoins out there. Good cryptocurrencies need two characteristics to be a good store of value, decentralization and a cap on total units issued. Ethereum’s blockchain is controlled by a relatively small group that can and does edit the blockchain, demonstrated by the June 18th, 2016 “DAO debacle” that led to a “hard fork”. Ethereum is a corporate offering. It’s purpose in being created was to extract maximum value from it’s investors. 
- - When will Ethereum change from POW to POS?
  - Based on his conversation, it seems that there will be a soft launch of POS in August or September ie a hybrid between POW and POS with the full transition happening by EOY. Vitalik has already created the POS repository to begin pushing code to prod ethereum/casper 
- - Can Ethereum reach the Bitcoins price?
  - Max Market Cap, aka “Ethereum will grow to be bigger than Bitcoin” Max market cap is a theoretical maximum that is calculated taking the market cap of the most popular coin in this case Bitcoin and plugging it in for a different cryptocurrency. In the Ethereum example, the formula is very simply Available Coins Ethereum / Market Cap Bitcoin 
- - Around what rate will ethereum stop falling?
  - According to Lanmar from Trading View, Ethereum will fall further to the 50  100$ range. Then the price will recover. Personally, I agree with it, we are now in a bear market. The speculators and inexperienced traders are panic selling. The whales big investors are waiting for a good low price to enter for Ethereum is still promising. There is no bad news in form of hacks, hard fork ... 
- - Why should I sell or hold Ethereum its at 475?
  - I think Ethereum is cheap compared to the value it should have. It can reach $1000 dollars, at least. Smart contracts are a true killer feature. Something that can change the world. Nobody has any idea of all the possible applications of a such disruptive technology. We have seen p2p loans, digital decentralized autonomous organization DAO, and ICOs, but it is only the beginning. 
- - How is Tezos different from Ethereum?
  - There are several commonalities between the two projects, but also important differences. First of all, both are decentralized ledgers and smart contract platforms implemented on top of a blockchain. In that respect they are very similar. Our differences fall in four categories governance, smartcontracts, consensus, and general philosophy. 
- - What are the major differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum? Which one is better, and why? Should I invest in Bitcoin right now or Ethereum?
  - BTC is a store of value i.e. a cryptocurrency. Ether is a token that will allow for computing / processing access to the Ethereum network. Note that Ether is what you are investing in, Ethereum is the network it is powered on. It isn’t technically a store of value in the same way as BTC. If/When everyone wakes up and realizes that, it could have major impact on the value of ether overall. 
- - Can Ethereum or Ripple exceed the Bitcoin?
  - In the recent years, Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market as a whole has been gaining alot of media and investor attention. However the fundamentals and uses of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple are rather different. Bitcoins are mainly used as a safe asset and a store of wealth whereby Ethereum is used as a foundation for decentralized applications to be built on. Lastly, Ripple’s transaction protocol are gaining the attention of banks and financial technology services worldwide. 
- - What are the best resources to learn Ethereum Solidity language?
  - Created by BitDegree, the first blockchainpowered online education platform, this course is the best first step you can take to learning Solidity. As a prerequisite you must know Javascript of course. Why? Read on.. How can I start with Solidity development? This is one question, I was being asked a lot. And I used to answer it with the usual, read the Solidity docs, or follow the online MOOC on various websites. 
- - Is Ethereum really that powerful?
  - Despite the fallout from The DAO hack, Ethereum is moving forward and looking to a bright future. By providing a userfriendly platform that enables people to harness the power of blockchain technology, Ethereum is speeding up the decentralization of the world economy. Decentralized applications have the potential to profoundly disrupt hundreds of industries including finance, real estate, academia, insurance, healthcare and the public sector amongst many others. 
- - Should I spend half my fortune on Ethereum?
  - Short answer, no. Long answer, still no. Ethereum is a GREAT invention and is leading to so, so many innovative projects. At the same time, Ethereum was developed in a way that made it easier to use than most other blockchain when it comes to creating your own tokens. For instance, you or I can go create an Ethereum ERC20 token within literally 30seconds. The value of that token is then created by the business model around an ICO. 
- - Why has Ethereum stalled?
  - The Ethereum network can only handle a certain amount of transactions per block. A project running on the ETH blockchain named Cryptokitties where you can collect and breed digital cats went viral and brought so many transactions to the ETH blockchain that it got stalled 
- - When will Ethereum reach $4000?
  - I was telling that we will see 3000$ in 2018. And I found that question and decided to answer. It depends on Ardr/Ignis platform progress. If they do what they are going to do they can take down Ethereum. If they don’t  we will easily see $4000 by the end of 2018 or Q1 2019. 
- - Is Bitcoin and Ethereum trading halal and allowed in Islam?
  - With the recent rally in cryptocurrency prices, questions appear to have been flooding in to Islamic scholars, leading to a new round of fatawa, or legal rulings, by prominent figures traditionally recognized as qualified in Islamic jurisprudence. 
- - Is it profitable to mine Ethereum with the new Amazon G3 Instances?
  - No. AWS is never going to be cheaper than buying your own hardware at home. Especially for an operation that you plan on running for months, its just easier to invest in the hardware once and manage from there. Very unlikely, it’s not very profitable to build your own rig at this point also 
- - Are Bitcoin and Ethereum prices linked? If yes, then how?
  - Technically Bitcoin and Ethereum are based on different locations. Since blocked in a different they are not related in any way. 
- - Is Ethereum Classic undervalued?
  - Given my current analysis no. In short It has neither the amount of transactions nor the community support for me to consider Ethereum Classic undervalued or desirable for investment. Ethereum and Ethereum Classic are not the same, so some of the ideas flying around out there that they should be equal are completely bogus. Ethereum has far more transactions and is the foundation of many other blockchains and decentralized apps. 
- - Now, which currency is best for an investment, Bitcoin or Ethereum?
  - I would say neither  but if I was forced to pick, I would say Ethereum. Why? Bitcoin is based on outdated technology and never updates its code. The only updates stemming from Bitcoin are minor upgrades in relation to block size, etc which branch off into other coins e.g. Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, the attempted Bitcoin2x... Bitcoin can only handle 7 transactions per second. Right now with the current mania going on, there is a HUGE backlog of transactions that are unconfirmed. Imagine what this will be like when 10 times more people start using Bitcoin.. the network would grind to a snail’s pace. What’s the use case for this in the future? You can’t buy a loaf of bread with it, especially if it’ll take a day to buy that bread. 
- - Is ethereum classic a good investment for 2018?
  - I don’t think so. It’s an older version of Ethereum and has no value to add. I told the developers at the time that is was simply an attempt to hijack the Ethereum name brand and create some value. Initially it rose on speculation, but isn’t worth much now. ETC would need to create some channels to market along with significant use cases to see a sustainable value increase. 
- - Why has Ethereum dropped so low? Will it start to come back up?
  - Off late, there has been a major pull back across the whole crypto market and Ethereum is no exception. As is always the case, there are probably a multitude of reasons for this however let’s look at a couple of key reasons which stand out 
- - Will ether ethereum hit $10 again in the short term?
  - No chance of Ethereum dropping to anywhere below 50USD. I know you may not want to hear this, but you are late. I hope you were not waiting for anyone to answer this. Hey, are you talking about Ethereum Classic? If you are, then there are chances. But then, do not try to time the market, my friend. The day Vitalik Buterin stops working on Ethereum, the price is likely to drop to $10. I will sell my ethereum the day I hear the news and so will rest of the investors. 
- - Is IOTA going to take over Ethereum in the long run? Also, if the scaling issue is solved in Ethereum, what is the future of IOTA?
  - Iota’s Tangle innovation is groundbreaking. Iota can do much more than just making zero fees transactions. The Tangle technology is easily scalable and immutable. IOTA nodes can operate offline without being connected to the main Tangle, and if they wish to connect later to the network, they easily can. In contrary to this, Ethereum has had a few problems itself mainly with the scalability. 
- - What is the expected price of Ethereum by 2022?
  - Personal guess — a minimum of $ 10,000 to $ 15,000 . If you go by the current trend which is price of Ethereum around 1/10 the the price of Bitcoins, then it may reach around $ 100,000 in case Bitcoin reaches $1000,000 Theabove graph shows how the price of Ethereum has change since it beginning in 2015. It started from below 60$ and reached a maximum of around $ 350 during mid of June. The current price is $265. 
- - What will happen to Ethereum if Bitcoin hard forks?
  - Nothing, Bitcoin has hard forked many times before Bitcoin Cash, Gold, Diamond and many others as has Ethereum Ethereum Classic. Here’s how a hard fork works Hard forks are intentional and are imposed by the developers of a blockchain. The developers impose a hard fork to change the rules of the blockchain. Bitcoin is on an open source blockchain, therefore developers can impose changes at any time. There are 2 ways a hard fork can go 
- - What is the next hot cryptocurrency, bitcoin is too pricey and Ethereum seems stuck?
  - You dont want to worry about what the price of 1 bitcoin is as of now. You dont have to buy a whole bitcoin. 1 bitcoin is huge. You can buy equivalent of the fiat currency you can afford. As you hold the bitcoins ,over a period of time your bitcoin will appreciate in value and give you a capital gain corresponding to your investment. I am investing in Bitcoin30pc , Ethereum20pc , LiteCoin30pc and Ripple20pc. I think these are the best cryptocurrencies to invest in. 
- - Will Ethereum markets keep being bullish?
  - Who knows? over what time frame? Ethereum is in my mind the cryptocurrency with the greatest potential to overthrow Bitcoin’s rule, but the Ethereum market is much less developed. Every nun, 3rd world farmer, and even Jamie Dimon, know what Bitcoin is. 
- - I made an Ethereum contract and realized how unscalable the network is. Will the Ethereum network ever actually be scalable?
  - The entire community is very aware of the situation. Scalability is a prime issue for most of the Blockchain platforms, and some are trying to come up with solutions that are built from scratch. The ex CEO of etherium has created something even better. I really believe in the project. He explains everything here

  - The best reason to invest in Etherium is a belief that distributed smart contracts will offer significant business benefits over more conventional forms of cloud computing and transactionclearing. 
- - How do I start buying Ethereum?
  - Get an Ethereum Wallet Hardware wallets Hardware wallets are the most secure way for storing Ether. The main hardware wallets that support Ethereum are Ledger and TREZOR. Software wallets 
- - As Ethereum and litecoin, etc. are decentralized, what is the benefit for its developers?
  - They are all nonprofit organizations, but their bucks hardly fit in my calculator… Why do we need decentralization? Main idea? REMOVE A MIDDLEMEN! And this makes sense. Accordingly, the conclusion follows, IF the organization that issued the token calls itself DECENTRALIZED, it must fulfill a number of requirements Since we are talking about those decentralized projects that don’t have profit. 
- - How do I become a certified Ethereum block chain developer?
  - Blockchain is a foundational technology that is going to impact a wide variety of industries. However, none of these will be doable over the long term if the demand for Skilled engineers is not met. We continue to speak to a lot of recruiters who find it tough to recruit Blockchain talent. There simply is too little compared to the demand. 
- - Why would ethereum go up in price?
  - Rollercoasters… Ethereum is a rollercoaster… and everybody loves a good rollercoaster. I don’t mean to be cheeky, I truly don’t. I’m simply having a spot of fun with this answer because, well, the analogy is just so good. If you’d like to see me explain the answer check out All Coins Considered Right, so why would Ethereum go up in price? 
- - Can Ark take over Ethereum?
  - All cryptocurrency market is very unexpected. As per current scenario Ethereum is better than Ark. Ethereum is surviving and improving in spite of crashing price of Bitcoin and many other popular cryptocurrencies. But we never know tomorrow condition may be different and Ark come up with better use. Cryptos price is totally dependent on what is the current popularity. Ark is a good startup. However, it doesn’t have reach, resources or global mindshare of Ethereum foundation. So No, IMO. 
- - Whats the safest Ethereum Wallet and what are the authentic sites to earn free Ethereum?
  - Im answering the unmerged question about the best ETH wallet because that was the original question I was viewing before it got merged. Also, I dont know any authentic websites that have Ethereum faucets free ethereum dispensers, but in my opinion going to uncommon websites for free stuff can open you up to phishing, hacking, and malware insertion attempts, so I would generally avoid it. 
- - Will Ethereum reach Bitcoin price or its just speculations?
  - Recently we see many headlines talking about the flippening that Ethereum will beat Bitcoin in market cap. The increasing value of Ethereum is in correlation with the booming of ICO and smart contracts on the blockchain. The Ethereum take advantage of the scaling civil war in the bitcoin ecosystem. As soon the Segwit2mb will be implemented on the Independence day1 August, the price of Bitcoin will increase in value. 
- - Does Ethereum have a problem with scaling just as we have seen with Bitcoin?
  - Can you believe cute, digital kitties congested the entire Ethereum network?! Ethereum does indeed have a problem with scaling similar to what we have seen with Bitcoin. Still in its infancy, the most popular smart contract platform needs to establish an infrastructure that can be used by billions around the world without security or scaling concerns. 
- - What does the enterprise Ethereum alliance mean for a small time Ethereum investor like myself?
  - The EEA’s existence means that the whole Ethereum ecosystem will benefit because of open research/discussion about the large issues that face Ethereum before it can become widely adopted. They are currently creating standards for smart contracts, transactions and addressing requirements for privacy, security, scalability, etc. If they are successful  Ethereum may be in more demand in the future  with entities buying Ethereum to use it not only to invest. 
- - How can I take advantage of the Ethereum fork?
  - Ethereum is a platform. So the best way to take advantage of it would be to actually use it. There are 100s of businesses that are being built on Ethereum, from Cryptokitties virtual beanie babies to an additional layer of security. Some day a brilliant mind will solve the scaling issue with Ethereum, along with many other cryptocurrencies, and will likely be one of the richest people on Earth. 
- - How will Ethereum make money?
  - The cash flows needs to be seperated.  First, the Ethereum foundation, which is behind Ethereum, owns part of the transactional currency called Ether which is worth real money. This virtual currency has a limited supply and before they launched Ethereum, they took some to fund the foundation. As a non profit they are very open about their finances, in their recent blogpost they disclose their current assets and holdings as of Q1 2016 
- - Will Ethereum go up past 400 this year?
  - It is a question how you define the value of ETH. The rise to $400 was fuelled by the ICO speculative demand. It was easy to flip your initial investment 2–3x. So many tried to do it, unless it didnt work anymore. Now the speculation goes in the other direction. Most of the ICOs will have to convert back to fiat money. As many of them got pretty insane valuations, market corrects down the ETH price. What is the next? Where is the next real usage of ETH? When the current correction will be over? 
- - When a proof of stake comes out, will Ethereum go up in price?
  - It will be incredibly bullish for many reasons I dont think the price will rise due to the restricted supply of coins. The last milestone, Homestead, brought a significant rise in price as Ethereum transitioned out of early testing phase and the team proved that they could build a reliable platform. PoS has always been a stated goal of the Ethereum Foundation and would be a major accomplishment. 
- - What has a higher chance of gaining 900% this year Bitcoin or Ethereum?

- - Whats the safest Ethereum wallet to use?
  - If you are looking for the absolutely safest wallet, you will need to get a physical wallet. Physical wallets are safer as not only do you need to have the actual wallet to access the Cryptocurrencies, but you need to know the password as well. It’s virtually impossible to hack physical cryptocurrency wallets. I would highly recommend the Ledger Nano S. It’s easy to use, reasonably priced, very secure and visually appealing. 
- - Is Ripple better than Ethereum? What are the technical and fundamental differences?
  - Having said all that, these are two pretty different assets that appeal to different audiences, which is why we’re probably see them take significantly different routes. Hope this helps! We must also seek Wisdom. BETA vs VHS Ripple vs Ethereum In the case of Ripple, which claims to be better than Ethereum at least in it’s adaptability and suitability to the incumbent industries. 
- - Which among Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple, and Ethereum is best to invest in, and how are the risk prospectives?
  - Litecoin is a quicker and far more scalable currency than Bitcoin, here’s why; LITECOIN

Ethereum provides a way to make the information technology world very easy, and that’s why Ethereum is called the web 3.0. All most the entire IT industry has adapted to Ethereum today. 
- - Where can I purchase Ethereum mining rigs?
  - It depends on where you are currently staying. Since I stay in Bangalore, I ordered it from a guy who is from my city. If he is from some other city, make sure if you are not technical, he comes and delivers you the product and makes it plug and play machine for you. Ofccourse, you will need to pay him extra, but that would not matter in the long run. Here’s a screenshot of what my rig generate in last 24 hours. It has 5 GPUs. 
- - Can Bitcoin do anything Ethereum cant do?
  - The one thing Ethereum will never be able to do is be the first to market. Bitcoin was first, and it has gotten a lot of recognition for this, rightfully so. Being first isn’t everything, but it does have huge influence over public perception. 
- - How much total ethereum will be mined?
  - I think, there are curently 92mil tokens. ~10 mil tokens are mined each year. But in ~1 year ethereum will move from POW to POS, with ~1% inflation instead of ~10% now. Which means, ethereum will have about 100mil tokens before POS, and ~120mil tokens in 2038. Correct me if I’m wrong. Thanks. Content Director For Cryptosomniac ————————————————————————————— 
- - Why do Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin prices drop every Thursday?
  - They don’t. It just happened several times. At other times it dropped on Tuesdays or Fridays or Saturdays. It is just your statistical bias working on you. You should stop trying to see some patterns where there aren’t any. 
- - Why do Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin follow very similar price paths?
  - Below are three scenarios that drive the price of these coins Scenario 1 Bitcoin and Ethereum are used to purchase other cryptocurrencies. Assuming a buyer wanted to purchase IOTA for example, first he needs to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum then exchange them with IOTA. That’s why BTC and ETH fluctuate so much. Scenario 2 
- - What will be the estimated price of Ethereum after the implementation of Casper? When will Ethereum shift from POW to POS?
  - I can’t answer the first question, but I can give some insight into the second part. POS has been anticipated on the Ethereum blockchain for quite some time. The first time it was mentioned as being ‘close to launch’ was in last 2016. However, this deadline has been pushed back again and again, as more testing into Casper the codename for Ethereum’s POS mechanism was conducted. 
- - When will the ethereum hard fork eth zero be, on 19 January 2018?
  - AFAIK the EtherZero team canceled the hard fork owing to lack of support for it. EtherZero Team Cancels Plans to Hard Fork Ethereum Hello, The min investment is 0.02BTC , i gave it a try and got in few hours!  Im very happy, im going to do it again soon when the transaction confirms. Just sharing this site while its still paying, they have alot of users so it will be working for some time i think.

- - How can I mine ethereum and bitcoin cash?
  - If you want to be a hobby miner than simply download application from minergate in you pc, laptop or mobile!. If your pc laptop has a graphics card than yoh can easily mine ethereum because ethereums mining algorithm works good with GPU. If you want to earn money by mining than I advice that at first try to start mining using whatever you have available and than calculate if mining is profitable for you or not Profitability depends on many factors Cost of electricity Cost of hardware 
- - Could Golem be as profitable as ethereum?
  - I think Golem is a great project with one of the best developing teams, clear roadmap and a usable product with beautiful designed UI  Brass Golem. Do understand that the beta product is a super computer that allows graphic developers use leverage super computing at low costs. Their nearest competitors  though not the same is Amazon who is working on cheaper cloud super computing since the innovative Mechanical Turk.

- - Where can I store Ripple, Bitcoin, and Ethereum in one wallet?
  - There are different types of Crypto wallets and some are easy to use while others have unmatched security. Actually, The security of the wallet depends upon where the private keys are stored. Whenever we create a wallet, a private key is generated. This private key gives access to the funds in the wallet. 
- - Is Ethereum expecting any corrections now?
  - Do note that this is just my own personal opinion, do not use it at any point of time as an investment advice. Hope this helps! What I believe is happening is called a parabolic shakeout. It’s when investors purposely fluctuate a stock to scare away the weak hands, making it easier for them to buy at better prices. I talk about it in my new video for my new series , Market Mondays starting at 020. 
- - Should I buy lots of Ethereum now and sell later in the future when the price rises like BitCoin did?
  - Definitely mate. But diversification is required. Do not put all your eggs in one basket. Try buying in dips as much as possible. Also, have a plan to book some profits on regular basis. Unless you sell them, it will just be a virtual currency. Happy Ethering. It is my opinion that Ethereum is currently in a bubble stage. 
- - How do I mine Ethereum using a phone?
  - Definitely fact check me on that—either way Electroneum is an interesting coin. And then in no time you will start to mine free Ethereum. there you’ll learn everything about Ethereum. I mined cryptocurrency with my phone. Sorry but I didnt. And Im not quite sure if anyone did or even anyone would want to. First off, A phone doesnt really provide the accessibility you get in a computer. Secondly, you require huge processing power to mine cryptocurrency. Even the best phones with 6GB RAM would crash. 
- - Are blockchains Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. GDPR compliant?
  - Original question ‘Are blockchains Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. GDPR compliant?’ There are several Blockchain qualities which makes it a subject to GDPR. 1. Irreversibility 2. Transparency There are two types of Blockchain – private and public. Bitcoin and Ethereum are based on a public blockchain. This means transaction data is always available. Individual users can practically browse through the whole transaction history. 3. Encryption 
- - Is mining Ethereum dangerous to the computer?
  - 62 degrees should be fine. What usually breaks down first are the fans. And if you fans are only running at 26% then it seems like you shouldnt worry too much about your GPU breaking down. However if a fan does break down then you should halt your mining operations to replace the fan.

- - Should I buy an Ethereum Classic?
  - The other aspect of the valuation is the fact people see ETC as a potential quick way to make a big return. If I buy ETC now while its only worth 1/10 of ETH  I have a good chance of making x10 on my return if this project really takes off. ETC is about to hit 10,000BTC of volume within the very first few hours of being open for trading. THAT IS INSANE. What this tells me is that the market is hungry for the battle between ETC vs. ETH. 
- - If Ethereum hard-forks into a new coin, will the current Ethereum continue to be adopted?
  - For a bitcoin cash style fork to work, you would need a lot of effort to convince the people to run your forked software, there has to be a demand for it, or some issue that is splitting the community. Just like BCC has to fight to adopt miners, devs and community members, and ETH hardfork will have to attract those limited resources to their chain. If they can get a community, they will survive. If not, theyll be part of the many chains that have failed.

Bitcoin is simply a Storer of value SoV. So on one hand we have a bubble illustrated quite well by a Hoftrsa professor I like to refer to when elucidating my consulting clientele regarding investment in crypto, as it very clearly illustrates the stages of a “bubble” and one can easily ascertain the difference between a trough, such as Ethereum is in actually considering prices one year ago we are still up like 2000%, so it has NOT crashed

  - Psychology. When it dropped rapidly from $400 to $200 it spooked a lot of investors. Some of those guys, want to sell into any rallies now, they are happy with what they’ve made and it’s time to cash out for them.

The hash that solves the block is the one that earns the pool the reward, which is then evenly distributed over the amount of shares.

I know you are freaking out of just by seeing the numbers. But this investment is all about abnormal returns with abnormally high risk and you reap maximum,the earlier you get aquainted into. 
- - Can Ethereum reach $250 billion in market cap?
  - Not impossible. Over the next 10 years we’re going to see some serious captail inflow into the cryptocurrency space, no doubt. More individuals are looking to invest. I have a friend who’s a trader at a large bank, he said a lot of high net individuals and family offices want to invest into crypto but there currently is a regulated way to do it. When platforms emerge i’m betting on Coinbase that allow people to invest via their money managers, it will explode.

Moreover, Zebpay is the most downloaded Bitcoin Wallet App in India. Getting Started with Zebpay App 
- - When will ethereum switch to proof of stake?
  - As Roland and John rightly point out, proofofwork mining is getting harder and harder with block times increasing exponentially as we approach the ice age. This was designed to force a switch to proofofstake, but given the delay, the Ethereum foundation has raised the possibility of delaying the ice age as part of the Metropolis fork in late 2017 [2]. 
- - Has anyone tried Ethereum mining in India?
  - Mining Ethereum is profitable is you do it the right way. You’ll need to build a mining rig with high powerful resources to make some amazing profits. if you want to know how much Ethereum mining can be profitable, then read the following article.

- - Will Ethereum price rise high in the short term?
  - It is incredibly difficult to predict where the price of Ethereum will go. This is not a matter of talent, or how “smart” you are — I mean, shit, you have possibly made a good deal of money investing in Ethereum. But now you have additional money to invest, and are unsure if now is the best time to buy. Even the best Ethereum traders/investors in the world are left dumbfounded about when to invest. 
- - Is Ethereum mainly supported by Vitalik Buterin, in other words, do we mainly count on Vitalik Buterin to develop Ethereum? Is the future of Ethereum mainly attached to him?
  - It is true that Vitalik is a key figure in the Ethereum community, but he is only one of a number of very intelligent developers that work on Ethereum. His activity on the network does affect the price of the Ethereum token. He had to dispel a rumour that he had died by using a picture of the latest block with it’s hash reference. The news of his fake death made ETH drop sharply and it then recovered quickly after this picture was revealed, which gives some indication of the link. 
- - What is the outlook for Ethereum by the end of the year?
  - Because of this, the price is likely going to fall, maybe even by a lot. This isnt an absolute guarantee, by the factors that would cause a spike in price just arent there. So so. I think Ethereum is at a good price point right now after coming down about 40%. But I do think the ramping ICOs are still going to cause problems for Ethereum in the near future. Until a better way ICOs can be conducted, Ethereum might be held down from its potential. 
- - What is Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple?
  - What is Cryptocurrency? Basically, a cryptocurrency is a digital token, designed to work as a medium of exchange, or a method of record keeping. However, it uses cryptographic algorithms to secure and verify transactions across its network and to control the creation of new tokens inflation. 1. Bitcoin 
- - What makes Cardano more valuable than Ethereum in the long term?
  - In addition, Cardano claims to take a scientific, peer reviewed approach to creating the project, something that is selfevident in the way they designed their white papers. One of the people I follow, Cryptocandor, has a couple of videos that goes into more detail on Cardano. If you’re interested in this project, I recommend you check them out 
- - In plain English and without jargon, what is gas in Ethereum?
  - I think before answering what is gas in Ethereum, it is important to understand what is Ethereum and Ether. Allow me to explain it a bit…. What is Ethereum and Ether? Official Ethereum project website says “Ethereum is a decentralized platform for applications that run exactly as programmed without any chance of fraud, censorship, or thirdparty interference.” 
- - Is Ethereum open source?
  - Ethereum essentially takes the idea of an open source blockchain one step further… “I thought [those in the Bitcoin community] weren’t approaching the problem in the right way,” Says Vitalik. “I thought they were going after individual applications; they were trying to kind of explicitly support each [use case] in a sort of Swiss Army knife protocol.” 
- - How do I learn how to make a profit from buying and selling Ethereum and trading Ethereum to Bitcoin, and vice versa?
  - Alas, there is no reliable way to learn how to make a profit buying and selling bitcoin. The secret, of course, is to buy low, and sell high. The trick is knowing when its low, and when its high. If everyone new how to tell that… no one would do anything except trade bitcoin and wed all be rich beyond our wildest dreams!!! 
- - Is it possible for someone from Saudi Arabia to invest in Bitcoins and Ethereum, through Coinbase?
  - No, it’s not. However, there are plenty of local opportunities still present in the country. 
- - Where can I buy IOTA with Bitcoin/Ethereum? And what wallets support it?
  - However, it may not be feasible for those who wish to deposit fiat currency other than USD. Wire transfers are available for 0.1 percent of the amount, with a minimum fee of 20 dollars. Express wire transfers, which are completed within 24 hours on business days, cost 1 percent of the amount, with a minimum fee of 20 dollars. 
- - If the gas price in Ethereum is driven by the market, how are developers stimulated to develop new applications on top of Ethereum?
  - That is the nice thing about Ethereum. They actually have a functioning group that is able to make decisions. Secondly it follows the free market principle. If the Gas price becomes high it is because there are valuable applications that run on the platform that are willing to support the price. It might not be the “iTunes” store that Vitalik is thinking of, but could be an Enterprise platform still cheaper than the alternatives. 
- - Why is Ethereum dropping today?
  - God is giving us a chance to buy some and #HODL Lol 
- - Is NEO or Ethereum a better investment?
  - Neo and Ethereum have the same role in the crypto world. Both of them want to become platforms for the new decentralized apps, initial coin offerings, and smart contracts. Smart economy means that all of the digitized physical assets will be proven ownership in the blockchain itself. Then, these assets can be traded or sold even leveraged with smart contracts. Because of the decentralized model of the blockchain, their ownership can be highly protected. 
- - Can I pay with Ethereum Cryptocurreny?
  - Taobao Age. offers the following services for a minimal fee of 5% of product cost There are a few site that do. And more sites are adding the support everyday. If you want to start accepting Ethereum as a form of payment on your website then try Tenno, it’s an embeddable payment form for Ethereum. Tenno pay with cryptocurrency online Far from an Ethereum expert, but Ether isn’t really intended for store front payments. It is intended to be currency for their decentralized computing platform. 
- - Will Cardano overtake Ethereum and become a truly future-proof, 3rd generation cryptocurrency?
  - The market is so young that noone truly knows which project will gain the highest market share. There are many competitors in this field. Cardano, Neo, Ethereum, EOS. Here is why I like Cardano Cardano also focusses on several other key elements that a lot of cryptocurrencies seem to ignore. Compliance... Cardano aims to be ahead of the game when it comes to compliance, meaning global governments / institutions are much more likely to partner with a firm where compliance is a prioirty. 
- - How high will ethereum price go?
  - It is incredibly difficult to predict where the price of Ethereum will go. This is not a matter of talent, or how “smart” you are — I mean, shit, you have possibly made a good deal of money investing in Ethereum. But now you have additional money to invest, and are unsure if now is the best time to buy. Even the best Ethereum traders/investors in the world are left dumbfounded about when to invest. 
- - Which is a better investment for 2018, Ethereum or Bitcoin Cash?
  - I don’t think BCash is a good project to invest though it is listed on top 5. Ethereum is an advancement based on the principle of blockchain that supports bitcoin but with a purpose that does not compete with Bitcoin. However, the popularity and rising market capitalization of Ether brings it in competition with all cryptocurrencies, especially from the trading perspective. ETH almost overtook BTC marketcap a few months ago. 
- - What does Ethereum mining do for the Ethereum ecosystem, and why would someone want to mine?
  - In a normal banking setup, we have a centralised system which will verify the transactions and update the ledgers Example A sends money to B, the bank will verify A single entity is performing all these operations. In Ethereum, there is no central authority. There is no centralised server or ledger. Everything is distributed among thousands of computer running Ethereum Server. 
- - Why is the supply of Ethereum not capped like Bitcoin is at 21 million?
  - If you look up ethereum on coinmarketcap you will notice that there isn’t a max supply of ETH specified as what we would have for Bitcoin  21 million . Max supply means the maximum amount of coins that would ever be created. According to the response by StephanTual on ethereum community forum, there won’t be a maximum supply. If this is the case, isn’t ethereum going to be ever inflated as more and more ethereum is produced every single year? 
- - Is Ethereum safe from hacking?
  - The Ethereum protocol itself is about as safe as you can get. Theres a story about a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who paid a security firm $500,000 to try to crack Bitcoin. After six months, they came back and said they couldnt break it. This is the same for the system that Ethereum is built upon. 
- - How does Ethereum protect its technology?
  - In an open source development model, there is no such thing as technology protection. The source is available for anyone to use. The most important factor of success, is the user base and advertisement. When I have an ethereum network with many nodes already participating, why should I invest to make something competitive, and try to bring nodes in? A twin technology can be made very easily. 
- - What are the characteristics of a successful Ethereum DApp?
  - In order for a Decentralised App to be successful it has to do something amazing to worth every digital token spent on it. A user needs to pay fees everytime he wants to access the DApp’s characteristics. It better be worth it, because they could easily use a centralised app for that. 
- - Is Ethereum likely to dip under $300 again?
  - I have been following Ethereum since the flash crash when it dipped from $400 to 10 cents and then flashed back to about $320. That was a Retail flush as Smart Money knocked everyone out of their positions and used algorithms to buy at the low and buy at every level on the way up. Now that they have accumulated a position starting at the low they have been buying in ranges as the price has been dipping from the $300’s back to $220 etc. They have been accumulating Ethereum. It has been stuck in a holding pattern around $280$320 for awhile. I believe that $280 is a level at which the next move up will be launched. 
- - What wallet is compatible with Ethereum Zero, apart from the Mist Ethereum wallet?
  - Hello again, Nicoleta!  
- - Do Ethereum-based altcoins directly affect the demand for Ethereum? In other words, is the price of Ethereum driven at all by its derivatives?
  - Yes, … and of course, no. Yes, in the sense that most ICO’s request payment in Ether, and also that any transactions on a ERC20 token contract require a small amount of gas which is essentially Ether to execute. No, in the sense that price of all cryptos is based 99.9% not a scientific figure on speculation, rather than any fundamental demand or utility. 
- - Is Ethereum taxable?
  - If you are given Bitcoin as payment, as a miner or through other means, you are taxed on the USD value at the time of receipt. So if you received 1 BTC in March of 2017, you mark that as income of roughly $1200, regardless of the price when your report your income. In addition, Bitcoin is treated as a capital asset, which means that it’s subject to capital gains taxes. The IRS does not view Cryptocurrency as a currency today, as it’s not tied to a nation state. 
- - Will the Ethereum Classic follow the Ethereum pattern in the future?
  - Who knows, it’s a scamcoin pushed by Bitcoin whales to devalue Ethereum’s name, eventually the whales will dump it. You can tell this because ETH/ETC markets have almost no volume, all the volume in and out of ETC flows through BTC. It might, It might not. I am not enlightened to know if any asset is going to perform and ultimately one must apply your own study to follow the charts and become familiar with recognising the trends so that you can make an informed decision. 
- - Do you think Ethereum could ever reach the same price as Bitcoin?
  - Hard to say, Price discovery is the reason why we are unable to measure the possible future price for ETH or any other crypto, since everything depends on supply and demand. It is easy to get lost as a beginner in the world of cryptocurrencies. The vision of Ethereum is an unstoppable decentralised computer, a platform that is showing the value of smart contracts on a public ledger blockchain. 
- - Where do I buy cryptocurrencies like Ripple and Ethereum in India?
  - It is very simple to start with Koinex, because they have already provided some videos about sign up, KYC process, deposit and withdraw of crypto, to place order and sell it, to withdraw money and they also have SUPPORT TICKET to raised concern/issue or any kind of help. 
- - What are some other cryptocurrencies that have huge potential upsides like Ethereum?
  - Litecoin. In short Overall, Litecoin’s technology as a currency and store of value is way ahead of anything on the market, the Chinese/Koreans also love it and it has huge trading volume out there. If I was to choose a coin to invest in right now and had some spare cash, no doubt it would be LTC.

- - Should I sell my Bitcoin and Ethereum? I purchased $500 of each in December and lost about 50% of Bitcoin and 10% of Ethereum so far, so should I hold or sell?
  - Hello, Val! Cryptocurrency is only in its beginning and you will be so confused when Bitcoin will be around 50k per coin and Ethereum around 3–5k. You definitely shouldn’t sell them UNLESS you know 100% that something really cool going to happen with some altcoins and their price will skyrocket multiplying your investments. 
- - Whats your price prediction for Ethereum for 2020–2022 best educated guess? I do understand that it is hard to actually predict.
  - You are right, it is impossible to actually predict ETH price that long into the future. What we can do today is figure out some scenarios and take an educated guess at the possibility and implications of each scenario. Here are my 4 scenarios about ETH future Worst case scenario The activation of so many ICOs on its blockchain brings out so serious problems that the trend reverses and no one thinks of using ERP20 tokens any more. 
- - Is Litecoin expected to rise faster than Ethereum next month?
  - There’s a couple of ways you can think about this…. Valuation Based On Market Cap On the one hand, Litecoin has a market cap that is 15X less than Ethereum right now ~$2 Billion vs ~$30 Billion. If Litecoin doubled in value, it would be worth ~$4 Billion, which is totally reasonable. For Ethereum to double in value, it would have to be worth ~$60 Billion, or to put it another way, become the highest cap cryptocurrency in existence. 
- - Why is Ethereum believed to be the future of the blockchain?
  - Rise of Ethereum Why this cryptocurrency skyrocketed 3000% in 2017 The gaining popularity of Crytpocurrencies on the back of the Bitcoin, now means South Korean and regulation in Banks will spur the blockchain to more mainstream adoption. Ethereum is gaining popularity and its value is rising Ethereum was founded July 30th, 2015 and since turning two is creating a lot of buzz. If the Bitcoin is seen as a shady form of digital gold 
- - Knowing almost nothing about Ethereum, but being familiar with Bitcoin, how do I start programming with Ethereum and Python?
  - Why Python? If you want to learn how to build dapps on Ethereum you should learn Solidity. I would say this question is dependent on your programming ability. If you have lots of experience just dive into Solidity, otherwise I would learn something like Python or JavaScript first. 
- - Are there any other cryptocurrencies out there worth taking a look at besides the 3 big ones Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin?
  - MobileGo district0x Besides the two tokens above, below is a list of tokens I appreciate and currently hold Bonus Resource Monero. Monero is the offshore panama bank account that you don’t want to tell the government about. It’s the coin with privacy by default, a solid community, backing from devs which work off contributions. Overall the best coin after the top 3. I’m considering adding a position in XMR and Decred very soon. 
- - What is the future of the Ethereum Blockchain token?
  - The Ethereum blockchain, as opposed to its token, are two very different things. Although the price of Ether or as defined in its smart contract as ETH with all exchanges using ETH on their systems to denote the token, somewhat rests on the success of Ethereum blockchain engine and its development community. I will answer the question in two parts because I’m not quite sure which you are alluding to Part one is all just my opinion. Part two is just facts on the Ethereum blockchain. Part one 
- - Is ethereum purely a pump and dump currency?
  - if you are entering the crypto space for the first time. There are 3 very important things to consider  There other important points here, you must admit to is this….. Cryptocurrency skeptics warn of another dotcom bubble, but remember Thats where Amazon and Google started Yes, theres probably a cryptocurrency bubble, who really knows, we cannot predict the future my friend, and its obvious that some ICO and coins are created on pure BS, and and some will fail a miserable death. 
- - What is the difference between a Coin Ether, a Token, and a Smart Contract on Ethereum?
  - Ethereum is a crypto platform that replaces the traditional system of distributing shares, currency etc. Here is what the terms you mentioned really are Peace. A token can be considered any digital asset that was created on a blockchain. Being an ERC20 compliant token is one of the most popular, but any asset that can be traded should be considered a token. 
- - In the future, will Ripple experience a price hike, like Bitcoin and Ethereum did?
  - Nice one. It’s a million dollar question. If many people believe that Ripple will reach summit, then people will invest in it. If many people invest in Ripple, then it will make it big. How can you influence it ? The problem is that no normal folk know what Ripple is. Here is how you can influence people and perhaps include them in the Ripple sphere. It’s the problem of cryptocurrencies. No normal people know about them. Tell them about bitcoins, explain them. Most don’t even know what a byte is. 
- - Which is a better cryptocurrency to invest in, Ethereum, NEM, or Ripple?
  - None in my opinion… 5 Digital Assets that have good future in the cryptospace in December could be Emc2, Dgb, Stellar… But if you give it some more time so the Digital Assets that have good future in the coming 1 year are listed below with reasons supporting them. Thanks for reading this article if you make any profit from my article I will be very glad but please do your own research before making any investments. We are the owners of our profits and losses.

  - Great question, which may highlight some of the limitations of the technology as it stands. The Stack This is the 30,000 feet view of the web3 stack Keeping things decentralized 
- - Will the value of Ripple and Ethereum rise again?
  - Yes it will rise definitely. If you are looking to make some better profits. Then invest in ripple for short term to medium term. Whereas Ethereum is suitable for all types of trades and that’s why i only trade using Ethereum. Trading of Ethereum is the best option to make more profits. Trading is usually done in cryptocurrency exchanges. There are plenty of them, to name a few coinbase, kraken etc. My recommendation is do not rely on any one exchange to trade all the time. 
- - Whats the next big price drop of Ethereum?
  - If I or anyone else knew, they would make a ton of money by selling now and re buying it knowing it will climb back up. NO ONE knows what will happen with stock markets. Asking online certainly wont get you definite answers either. Stocks fluctuate. Do research and try to come up with when you personally think shifts in price will happen 
- - How will staking ethereum work?
  - Most likely you will hold Ethereum in your wallet and have an open connection to the blockchain. This will generate mining income for you, instead of having to buy hardware that “prove” they have done work in order to receive compensation. By holding ETH in your wallet and showing that every block to the blockchain, you “prove” you have a certain stake in ETH and thus are entitled to a share of the newly minted coins. 
- - What is the website for Bitcoin and Ethereum mining?
  - Bitcoin and Ethereum both are very strong altcoins and accepted almost every where in crypto coin exchange community. Mining is the best way to earn and increase the number of coins within your wallet. They are leading mining providers with various options to mine any cryptocurrencies such as hardware, software, GPU/CPU but the best option is cloud mining. There is a lot you get with HashGains mining plans, some are listed below 
- - Given that the Bitcoin blockchain is 151GB, and the Ethereum blockchain is185GB, how viable are smart contracts at scale?
  - I’m a database expert and I can tell you that the problem with scaling will not have much to do with the size of the blockchain, but with the frequency of transactions. Simply keep in mind that transactions that are pending to be added to the blockchain will be done so without regard to those transactions that have already been certified in prior blocks. 
- - Where can we buy Ethereum and Litecoin in India through INR?
  - Currently the best merchant in India to buy multy crypto is here with any Indian Bank account with KYC approvd within 48 hrs. Good Luck !

- - Are cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum just a passing fad?
  - Its difficult to say whether it will continue to be the major cryptocurrency 100% sure. But if it was a fad, would you think the financial industry, the IRS and the SEC would be keeping their eye on it? The big banks have already looked into researching the blockchain for their own purposes. Legitimate big time Venture capitalists have invested lots of money into Bitcoin related ventures, in amounts more than 1B USD. Look at Coinbase, VCs including Andressen Horowitz have invested 100M already. 
- - I want to invest in Ethereum and ripple. Is it a good investment and where do I buy as a cryptocurrency newbie?
  - They make the process quite simple and have a robust 2FA security protocol using Google Authenticator, which makes it harder for wouldbe hackers to simply gain access to your funds say even if they were able to steal your password via a phishing attack or introduce keylogging malware onto your device. Furthermore, 98% of your digital assets are stored offline and they also deploy Shamir Secret Sharing to securely split your private key, encrypt it, and geographically distribute it. 
- - What is the easiest way to get started with making DApps on the Ethereum platform?
  - The easiest way to get started making Dapps is by first understanding how blockchain technology works in general. Making effective requires the paradigm shift to thinking in terms of decentralized services. Without that knowledge, you’ll be able to code Dapps, but you’ll be less effective in making good applications. 
- - What are some great things about Ethereum?
  - Top three great things about Etherum  Ethereum is written in turning complete code language. For a computer to be turning, it must be capable of running any algorithm. Because of turning complete language any scrip can run on ethereum. The Ethereum blockchain records things more rapidly than bitcoinprocessing transition in 12 second.This makes the ethereum blockchain the best network to support any business or program. 
- - Can Lisk beat Ethereum one day?
  - It’s unlikely. Lisk is more advanced in terms of having sidechains riding on top the main chain but they’ve been out just as long as Ethereum and haven’t seen much traction. They are more focused on the ecosystem than just being a platform. Also many of the Lisk team left for ARK and they are now competing in the same realm. The Lisk foundation does have a huge cash pile so they should be able to last for a long time. 
- - Whats your take on Ethereum?
  - Ethereum is the real deal. Bitcoin’s smart little brother Ethereum is on the rise and after Smart Money is finished accumulating it expect a sharp rise next leg up which should be starting from about $280. Ethereum will have a fantastic journey. Ethereum holds much promise for the future of blockchain technology and the cryptocurrency space. I have written an entire article dedicated to Ethereum in my official Quora blog 
- - Is it possible, given the beating Ethereum has taken, that this is how the switch happens Ethereum keeps dropping and Ripple takes the #2 slot?
  - Ripple is a scam coin. Ripple labs is where the technology and innovation takes place. The company did a great job in making it look like the xrp the coin has a use which it currently doesn’t. Banks can’t use the coin due to it passing borders which contravenes existing data laws. The use of xrapid is being tested by more than 100 companies. Recently there has been a test done by mastercar. The details are available in the internet for verification. 
- - What are the main factors affecting cryptocurrency ethereum in particular price?
  - Singapore is the first country, that will issue a token, on Ethereum blockchain. I think that this is the event that drives Ethereum so high. Russia is looking to do the same as Vitalik ethereum’s creator, had a meeting with Putin. 
- - Does ConsenSys use Ethereum or Ethereum classic?
  - ConsenSys uses only Ethereum not Ethereum Classic. The founder of ConsenSys, Joseph Lubin, also cofounded Ethereum. He was a huge advocate of the hard fork that in his words, “excised the The DAO cancer and returned ETH to the token holders of record before the attack”. I doubt ConsenSys will ever use ETC. Ethereum all the way. ETC isnt really supported by most Ethereum companies, with Consensys companies being no different. 
- - What kind of ICO projects need their own token, instead of using Ethereum, Bitcoin, or other more established infrastructure coin?
  - If the project has a token that is integral to its business, it makes sense to use that same token for its ICO, as well. Many projects confer proportionate voting rights, or other membership privileges, proportionately to the amount of tokens owned, provided that token owners meet basic requirements, such as running a node for the project’s network. 
- - Bitcoin is going up like crazy, how about litecoin and ethereum? Will it go over 1000 at least in 3 years?
  - 3 Years is a long time. Anything can happen. Cryptos can fade or may be banned. Who knows? Estonia just tried to come up with their eresidency crypto based plan and had to give up on European Union pressure. Crypto’s are just too threatening to governments, control’s and monarchies. Ethereum I have always believed that Ethereum isnt a 1000+ USD coin. It may touch the 1000 USD mark but will always somehow remain there or nearby. And I have explained that in numerous of my answers. 
- - When will Ethereum reach mass adoption?
  - Due to how immature the Ethereum development community is today, I feel we’re at least 3–5 years away from the first ‘big’ DApp. When I learn a new technology, I spend a day researching the best books and online courses to learn the material. I will evaluate a dozen resources and find the one that best fits what I want to learn. For most technologies, this is easy, but for Ethereum, it’s a choir. 
- - How do I get my friends to stop buying Ethereum?
  - Ive done over 2000 hours of research on ETH alone, and I decided to buy. Already in nice profit. Why stop your friend?, I do not understand the question, but he might have done even more research then me, and can spot another alternate reason to buy this technology as its in its infancy!. He sounds smart, but I cannot tell the future…..neither can he! 
- - After the Ethereum fork, will I have Ethereum on both chains?
  - There will not be two chains when Ethereum hard forks. This fork is well supported by the community, which means that there is not faction to ‘pick up’ where the old chain is being left. Because of this, the hardfork will only produce one cryptocurrency. 
- - Which is technologically stronger, bitcoin or Ethereum?
  - Both are , both are solving two different problems . bitcoin is the most secured and encrypted cryptocurrency used of exchange of values and ethereum is best platform for building decentralised blockchain app. For daily news on cryto currencies and developement and ICO. Subscribe here  Ethereum is stronger, because the network can run code call Smart Contracts, programmed in a special programming language called solidity. Bitcoin is only a token. 
- - Is it too late to make a profitable investment in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies?
  - Not at all. Just because Bitcoin and Ethereum were already very profitable for the ones who got in early, it doesn’t mean they won’t continue being in the future. Currently, crypto currencies and other blockchain digital assets are evaluated at about $100bn. That’s a very small fraction in the world of financial assets and these technologies can do a lot of things besides digital currency. 
- - What are the most profitable applications for Ethereum?
  - Currently, the most profitable activities utilizing the Ethereum blockchain are all exchange and investment based. Exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken and Poloniex, which charge a small fee to move currency utilizing their platform. The Dapp development community, while growing and enthusiastic, hasn’t produced a high number of products. This is because the platform is only two years old and has a fair amount of infrastructure that still needs to be built. 
- - What makes Bitcoin and Ethereum prices go up and down?
  - While fiat currency value fluctuations are fairly complex, and can be caused by numerous factors, cryptocurrencies are a little easier to understand. Cryptocurrencies are, basically, valued by supply and demand. If you log into a cryptocurrency exchange such as bittrex, you will see the bid and ask values for each currency. If there are only sellers, then the supply is high, then the price would plunge. If some good news in relation to the cryptocurrency comes in, there will probably be a lot of demand and consequently a lot of buying action. Other factors that affect any given cryptocurrency are new laws / regulations, what the developers are doing and, if they decide to ‘cash in’ their share and flood the market, the performance of other cryptocurrencies for instance, when bitcoin spikes, sometimes other cryptos fall as people sell their altcoins in exchange for bitcoins because they want to be in on the rally, and last but not least, network issues. During the last several weeks, the bitcoin blockchain transaction time has been delayed, and transaction costs are becoming quite expensive; this makes people question whether bitcoin is really capable of mainstream use as a currency though some would argue that cryptocurrencies are not actual currencies but should instead act as a currency within apps and other programs built utilizing its blockchain. On any blockchain, transactions require certain things… you can think of it as… working for money. And this work comes at a cost. 
- - What should I consider before investing in ethereum rather than bitcoin?
  - These are my considerations for holding Ethereum instead of Bitcoin. Again, these are just my personal opinions. I’m pulling these out of my emotional ass, and I suspect that my true reason for hodling ETH is simply because I’ve made the most from it before. 
- - How important is it that Singapore has tokenized its dollar on the Ethereum blockchain?
  - I think it is very important. Let me explain. Up until now cryptocurrencies have generally been a retail investor phenomenon. Large institutional investors like pension plans, asset management firms, and banks have for the most part stayed on the sidelines. For example, last month, I had the chance to attend a talk by the head currency trader at a large Wall Street bank. Naturally, at the end of his talk, I asked him what he thought about cryptocurrencies. 
- - What are some suggestions in price arising of Ethereum and Litecoin?
  - Trade. Ethereum looks like has a temporary ceiling of $500, so if it goes to say $300 it is a superb opportunity, imho. Litecoin is married to bitcoin. So as long as bitcoin appreciates, its silver appreciates also. We are in short correction phase right now. Would be not surprised if say LTC will try high $70s in the next 2 days. If you want to invest, then may be purchase over time to average up the holding. This is not an investment advice, just some musings on the subject. 
- - How is Ethereum different from other altcoins?
  - To understand the difference between Ethereum and other Altcoins, we must understand what Ethereum is and then how it differs from others? Ethereum is one of the most desirable technology in the world of digital currencies. Since it went live in mid2015, with 11.9 million coins premined for the crowdsale, Ethereum prices have grown by over 5,700% during 2017. Ethereum value recorded a 64 fold increase, that is $700 million to $45 billion. Ethereum’s superior technology 
- - What are the chances of ethereum tripling in value in 2018?
  - Onethird 33%. If you model the price as a random walk, the chance to hit some value before it hits zero is current price divided by target price. And since you want triple, that’s onethird no matter the values. There are more complicated and probably more accurate ways to do this analysis, but the above is probably not entirely unreasonable. 
- - How does a bubble break, like the Ethereum bubble?
  - Consider the following series O,T,T,F,F,S,S,? What is the next letter in the series? scroll down . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Did you have an “aha” moment? 
- - In what way do Stratis and Ethereum differ?
  - Couple of changes right off the bat Looking at the two platforms, it seems like Stratis is really banking on making it big via the C# backend, making it easy for .Net developers to use blockchain technology. While this might not have the development community that Ethereum has, it will be interesting to Microsoft to have a C# alternative so prevalent in the market. If it continues to progress, having Microsoft as a key ally could make it very important. 
- - What is the biggest risk facing Ethereum?
  - In summary, it is a pretty exciting new technology and has great potential to influence the world, but you should always understand the risks that go hand in hand with it. Ethereum is grinding to a halt because it is overloaded with transactions from a site called cryptokitties. If the ETH network cant handle one game site made for kids, it will never be a global settlement network. ETH cannot scale… so its days are numbered… 
- - What are some Ethereum startups from India?
  - Mudra Startup Token MST is based at Noida. It is under development right now. Here is the basic concept and schedule. Concept Microfinance and Venture Capital for startups worldwide. Schedule We need a technical team on equity basis. If you are an open source coder with LAMP, Javascript and Cloud Hosting experience, you can join us on equity basis. We need people near sector 63, Noida. 
- - Should I sell my Ethereum now as it has reached $1,000?
  - Why is ethereum rising in price now, while any other altcoin is dipping? My personal opinion is that the price will continue to surge because of the etherzero fork Jan 19th 2018 GMT 19002100. Every ether owner will receive the same amount of etherzero in their wallet for free. This is not an investment advice. If you ask me now, then my answer will be big NO. 
- - Can we trust HashFlare for Ethereum mining?
  - I have started mining recently, its been only 3 months. There are lot of factors associated which results in profitability. Current price, Mining Difficulty, Maintenance. I started with ZEC mining, looking at the current returns i think i can get my ROI in 8 months. Current price ZEC=400$ I brought another big contract for ETH mining in feb, and there the ROI is 10 months Current price ETH=850$ As the price falls or increases the ROI changes. 
- - Did anyone get any Ethereum really cheaply today?
  - I do enjoy Charles Marino and Amine Mouffok’s answers to the question. However, they do not answer the question “Did anyone ACTUALLY EXECUTE AND SUCCEED at getting Ethereum really cheaply today?” Their answers are excellent examples of how one would program a trade  dont get me wrong. The reality is that the algorithmbased answers may not reflect the reality of market trading. 
- - Should I buy Ethereum now or should I wait?
  - Yes you can buy. The thing with Ethereum is, if you are a trader or an investor, it doesn’t matter when you buy. What matter is how you sell it. Millions of people buy Ethereum everyday, making Ethereum the most demanded and the most sold cryptocurrency. This is a plus point for traders. Ethereum traders sell and trade Ethereum on the top exchanges. With millions of people ready to buy Ethereum everyday, you can easily make multiple trades in a single day. Making yourself amazing profits. 
- - What are some examples of Ethereum in use today?
  - There are quite a lot projects around at the moment that are building upon the Ethereum Network. As you may know Ethereum is famous for their DApps, short for “Decentralized Application”. A DApp basically is like an App, except that it is distributed among thousands of nodes. A “centralized” application is running on a single server whereas the DApp runs on thousands of nodes. Of course there are much more projects around at the moment but here is a short list of some of them 
- - Ripple is now more valuable than Ethereum, when is it going to be more valuable than Bitcoin?
  - Ripple unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum is a product that is being used by various big banks due to the fact that it brings down the cost per transaction because it is able to execute transactions faster. That is the part of what the product does. BTC $14.4k ETH $740 XRP $1.78 Marketcap BTC $ 241b ETH $71.5b XRP $69b Ethereum and Ripple in terms of marketcap are pretty much on equal terms, but the indivual prices of the coins differs massively. 
- - What can you do in real life with Ethereum?
  - As I am a little bit familiar with the logistics, I will take a use case from this industry. Let’s say you want to ship a pallet of goods to your friend Bob. You trust Bob, but you don’t trust trucker Tom, who will carry your pallet. On the other hand, Tom does not trust you as well, maybe you won’t pay? Or you do not have money to pay him at all? 
- - Is it safe to enter Ethereum at $386 initially?
  - No. Cryptocurrencies are as unsafe as an investment can get, at any price. ICO with little or no use pop up like mushrooms on a wet autumn day. Whether or they are legal is still up for debate, and that adds uncertainty to the market. Prices are therefore very volatile, and this months stable basis can seem like an unreachable goal next month. All your perceived profits can vanish and reappear in no time. 
- - Bitcoin has risen to 10k, but Ethereum is dropping. Is now the right time to buy Ethereum?
  - Depends on if you think Eth will rise over the next 2–3 years or not. If you believe it will, and you think the current $9xx prices as of mid Feb is undervalued then yes  it’s a great time to buy. If on the other hand you think that long term Eth is going to plummet then no  now is not a great time to buy. #notinvestmentadvice  do your own research 
- - Is it worth learning Blockchain and Ethereum technologies, from a career perspective?
  - If you have the inclination, it is worth learning an engineering discipline. It was the single best decision I made in my career and has brought me more opportunity than I could imagine, including the ability to be relevant in the blockchain industry today. 
- - Why does the Ethereum rate fall? Will it continue to fall?
  - The biggest reason is bitcoin’s decline due to the possibility of a hard fork. Investors are fearful that bitcoin will fail which could crash the whole market, so many are cashing out. 
- - Why did JP Morgan buy Ethereum and now says Bitcoin is fraud?
  - I believe that Jamie Dimon stated his own opinion there. He did not make a statement on behalf of JP Morgan. Many people compare the current rise of cryptocurrencies to the tulip craze. This is a fair comparison on some level. Like with tulip bulbs, prices are likely to collapse if directly affected by new regulations. 
- - How do I invest in ethereum and bitcoin in India?
  - There are indian cryptocurrency wallets which will allow you to buy, sell, invest and trade cryptocurrency of your choice. My all time favorite cryptocurrency is Ethereum, because it is a lot in demand right now all across the globe, which is a good sign for traders like me to generate some good money. Ethereum helps you to create softwares and deploy it easily. You can create your own company or your own startup using Ethereum network. 
- - How can I buy ethereum in Philippines?
  - I will give you a short and crisp answer, go to coinswitch .co and exchange ETH from BTC. Happy Switching  Best way is to buy bitcoin there and send it to your excahnge account at Bitfiix, you will get ultimate options to trade with coin. Convert your coin to ETH in this exchange. Buy ethereum and other crypto currencies/tokens directly from people Local Bitcoins Buy ethereum and other crypto currencies with credit/debit cards Coin Mama 
- - What is the difference between Litecoin and Ethereum?
  - TL;DR Litecoin is a fork of Bitcoin, so it has stuff like UTXOs, Bitcoinstyle block headers, etc. It does not at least right now, have Turingcomplete code execution and smart contracts. Ethereum is written from scratch, to be used as a radically more robust blockchain than Bitcoin. It has Turingcomplete smart contracts which can be programmed and deployed on chain. 
- - What are the most successful Ethereum DApps so far?
  - Crypto Sportz Platform is designed as an easy and secure way to make bets with friends on sports. It is powered by the blockchain, which means peertopeer, decentralized wagers on sporting events through smart contracts. Crypto Sportz project will not change the world but at least its something that gets people using crypto, smart contracts, etc. and is creating a real usecase for someone that has a passion for sport and crypto. https//www.cryptosportz.com 
- - Are there any limits to the size of the Dapp running on Ethereum blockchain?
  - So, there’s a bit of a misconception here with the idea of a Dapp. Yes, Dapps have parts that run on the blockchain, but that’s a small but critical part of their functionality. These Dapps will utilize smart contracts on the blockchain and those will run 100% on the Ethereum Network. However, the code to run a smart contract is relatively small. 
- - Is Ethereum ETH a good alternative to Bitcoin?
  - ETH and BTC are very different and definitely not replacements for oneanother. Without getting too technical, think of BTC as an innovation and ETH as a platform that utilized BTC’s technology. If you’re new to they crypto space, take a look at a tool I’m building to help people get involved. This is only a test but I always love getting feedback. Robo Advisor 
- - Will the Raiden Network price be more than Ethereum?
  - No. This mindset is a losing proposition. Raiden Network could be a great investment, don’t get me wrong, but it’s price will not eclipse Ethereum. Don’t expect it to. Why do you think so many people bought Ripple recently? Because they thought “this is like buying Bitcoin when it was only $2!!” No, because Ripple has a total supply of 100 billion coins, whereas BTC is only 21m. If Ripple’s price were to match Bitcoin’s the world would basically explode. Does that make any sense? Chris 
- - Should I invest in Bitcoin or Ethereum next year, and why?
  - Yes, I would aslo diversify to other Altcoins like Cardano and Neo. Here’s my view on the markets in 2018… Cryptocurrencies have had a wild ride this year, the Market Cap went from just over 18 Billion USD to just shy of 360 billion, increasing over 20x this year alone. Although the year is not over I wanted to provide my opinion on where I think the markets will go next year. This is just the beginning 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 
- - What is the difference between Ethereum and NEO platform?
  - Check the benefits of NEO 1 Much faster 1000 transactions per second which can be 10,000 with optimisation and blocks clear every 20 seconds and this could possibly even be reduced to 1 second if so desired. 2 Far less energy usage due to decidated bookkeeping nodes. 3 Cannot fork. 4 Support for multiple programming languages. 5 Proper consensus mechanism to come to decisions. 6 Has two tokens NEO and GAS and thus offers greater flexibility. 7 Will be quantum resistant. 
- - Should I sell my Ethereum now or wait?
  - No, hold all crypto currency unless your evidence convinces you the asset is overvalued. These should be considered stores of value and held for the long term. Invest for your future, the present will take care of itself. I will only say that I am holding onto my Ethereum as the price will likely go back up after the upcoming Bitcoin fork when everyone sells to take their Bitcoin profits and reinvests in altcoins like Ethereum. 
- - Why are the prices of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum rising these days?
  - A little over two months ago, Bitcoin achieved a symbolic milestone After an intensive period of growth, the price of one Bitcoin surpassed the price of an ounce of gold. That seems like ancient history. The price of Bitcoin has nearly doubled since then and the cryptocurrency is currently trading at about $2,200. Bitcoins cousin Ethereum is trading at about $180, its price increasing by a cool 1400% in the last three months. 
- - Why is Ethereum going up inspite of the parity exploit?
  - Who cares about parity bugs? They messed up their code inhouse for what I understood That is a minor setback for the ethereum community, the fault was on parity and eth just got a little more scarce until they fix it up  Than again, correct me if I am wrong, cause I haven’t looked to deep into it 
- - How much interest can you earn with staking Ethereum?
  - It’s unclear at this time what the exact “block reward” would be should Ethereum move to a full Proof of Stake model. I’ve seen many values thrown around by many different sources some of which are highly creditable while others not so much so there’s really no clear answer yet. The only obvious thing at this point is that block rewards under PoS will become clearer down the road and will be established in order to facilitate the full transition. 
- - What are the pros and cons of Bitcoin versus Ethereum?
  - Bitcoin is the one face of the digital coin falling in the category of cryptocurrencies whereas Ethereum is another face of the digital coin falling in the category of tokens. These two categories of digital coins are competing against existing money and gold to replace them with a truly onesingle currency and accepted globally. Bitcoin is surely a good and first choice for investment according to the experts. Whereas Ethereum is the second after bitcoin. You can’t really compare the two. 
- - Can Ethereum change the world?
  - theres CLEARLY a lot more to it, but im running late and thats what i got with the time i got, lol…. ; 
- - How dominant could Ethereum become in the future of the blockchain?
  - When I began learning Solidity, Ethereum’s language for writing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine EVM, I was happily surprised by the number of tutorials, libraries and frameworks available to developers. Even though the language and its constructs can be challenging at times, frameworks such as Truffle make it easy to get started. Ethereum’s rich set of tools, large dev community and corporate alliances, not to mention the number of nodes in operation more than Bitcoin, tell me that Ethereum is here to stay and could one day become the dominant blockchain. 
- - Can ethereum be affected by quantum computing?
  - Yes  neither Etherium nor Bitcoin use quantumsecure crypto, because those algos are still in the academic pipeline until we figure out how to make them practical. There’s decent hope this will happen before someone builds the first quantum computer capable of breaking Bitcoin and Etherium, but it’s far from certain. This’ll likely be resolved one way or the other crypto broken or secured against QCs within two decades or so. 
- - What are the major differences between Ethereum and Bitshares?
  - Bothe Ethereium and Bitshares 2.0 are development platforms to build decentralized blockchain applications This comes with standard code base to support asset exchange business, referral rewards program, price stable and federated cryptocurrencies, collateralized bond market etc. which is more friendly to banking and trading companies Hope this helps 
- - Will the Bitcoin hard fork affect Ethereum price?
  - That being said, although Ethereum is somewhat affected by the price of Bitcoin, it may also be a rally point for other investors as that would be seen as a safer coin to put money during this highrisk period. Yes, it already is. BTC is most peoples entry and exit point into cryptocurrencies. Ethereum has a great cases as a long term stand alone currency, but it’s still very much the case that movements in Bitcoin still greatly effect ETH. 
- - What is the process for investing in Ethereum?
  - The process is not different for Ethereum, it’s the same with every digital currency. If you’re a newbie; Good luck! Webinar Cryptocurrency  What You Must Know Just buy it and hold. There’s no process. Don’t overthink. 
- - What are the pros and cons of developing on Hyperledger vs. Ethereum?
  - At a practical level, developers who want to build an application or start an industry on such platforms, have to make a choice. Hyperledger and Ethereum, both are highly flexible, but in different aspects. Ethereum’s powerful smart contracts engine makes it a generic platform for literally any kind of application. However, its permissionless mode of operation and total transparency comes at the cost of performance scalability and privacy. 
- - What are the pros and cons of investing in ether Ethereum?
  - Created by math prodigy Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum is second only to Bitcoin in the hierarchy of cryptocurrencies. Ethereum’s blockchain not only validates a set of accounts and balances but also states. This means that Ethereum can not only process transactions but complex contracts and programs. 
- - Is exodus.io a safe wallet for holding bitcoin and ethereum?
  - I don’t know how ‘safe’ you are looking for or what does ‘safe’ means to you. If safe means, security, not hackable, no bugs etc. then you need to know that almost anything can be hacked that has the least to do with internet. If safe means, privacy of most importance to Cryptocurrency users, nontraceable funds etc, then pay heed to the following. Pros 
- - Is the price of Ethereum going up good or bad?
  - I think you can make a case for both sides pro and con for the rapid increase in Ethereum’s price. Here’s a short list of arguments ProPrice Increase of Ethereum ConPrice Increase of Ethereum So even though people might be making a lot of money, there’s always the hidden downside that needs to be considered. I think most people who hold Ethereum want the price to go up, but this doesn’t mean there won’t be problems. Good for Ether holders. Bad for bitcoiners 
- - With Ethereum ETH moving to Pos, will all ERC20 tokens built on Ethereum also move to Pos?
  - Follow our blog, we are going to write detailed article about PoS, ASICs and more… Thinking | Concise Software It is actually already partial but the main stakeholders are not pushing it yet To the next fork and beyond!!! It is good to fork! 
- - What are the top 10 GPUs to mine Ethereum?
  - Ethereum mining is a great way to obtain Ethereum if you don’t want to flat out buy the currency. But you need to make sure the GPU you buy is profitable. There are a few things to look at when you buy a GPU. The hash rate is the rate the GPU mines at, the power consumption is how much power the GPU uses, you should also look at how much power costs in your area, and you obviously need to consider the initial cost of the GPU. 
- - What is the best currency to invest in now Ethereum, Ripple, or IOTA?
  - All three!! Ethereum needs no introduction. Ripple is widely being adopted in the banking sector. And IOTA is being implemented extensively in internet of things applications. Ripple  no, cloud hangs over them, and the team. 3 words here “RUN FOR HILLS” IOTA  is a new comer, but has less complicated. 
- - If Ethereum is a decentralized currency, how can be attacked by DDoS?
  - Decentralised currencies such as Ethereum and Bitcoin use a chain of blocks to record the all of the transactions in the network. Users can contribute to the growth of the block chain and get rewarded by solving a so called proofofwork, where they have to find a solution to a puzzle usually partial collision of a hash function. The difficulty of the proofofworks increases as the number of the users in the network increases and as these use more developed hardware to solve these puzzles, in order to keep a constant growth rate. 
- - Is Ethereum or Tezos more technically challenging to understand?
  - Let me make an attempt to explain it. This resulted in people building unsafe structures like DAO which was a disaster. Soliditys formal verification on the top is like ability to have building safety codes. Tezos can be seen as complex building blocks where every piece is verified to be safe. So your pieces can’t even come together if the resulting structure is unsafe. So which is more technically challenging? My personal opinion  Tezos. 
- - When should I sell Ethereum?
  - You should sell your Ethereum when you need money or when you have reached the profit you aimed for. But as long as you can HODL, you should HODL. Personally, I think Ethereum is the cryptocurrency with the most potential. I will not sell before it reach $2 000 or $3 000. 
- - What would happen to Ethereum prices if somebody such as Bill Gates all of a sudden purchases 3 billion dollars worth of Ethereum coin? Could someone with that kind of wealth manipulate the market?
  - Right now, banks are hell bent on buying as much Bitcoin and Ether as they can. I am not making this up. See recent news regarding EU banks. Big money has always manipulated financial assets. They’ll continue to do so. So dont sell your BTC to banksters Banks know they are in deep trouble as this blockchain thing cannot be stopped. They’ll definitely HODL it, thus taking more coins out of circulation. 
- - What do Koreans do with Ethereum? Why is there such high demand over there? Do they build decentralised apps with Ethereum?
  - One way to think of this is that Koreans are early adopters of Ethereum or any other cryptocurrency for that matter. The demand that you are referring here would be the interest from investors. Investors do understand the potential of Ethereum and want to get on the bandwagon early on. Hope this helps! they speculate 
- - How do I setup Ethereum mining on AWS?
  - Check out the following article. It explains how to setup ethereum on ubuntu 16. Once you’ve an Ubuntu based VM on aws you can simply follow the instructions given in the article >> start your own ethereum blockchain | nodejsera This is pointless as the hash rates are no where near as good as if you had the discrete GPU’s yourself. Not to mention with Ethereum implementing Casper soon, PoW will be obsolete. Mining a coin other than btc/eth may be more profitable. 
- - Where can we buy & sell Ethereum classic in India?
  - Top Sites to Buy Ethereum Classic in India #1 IQ Option 
- - How do smart contracts in Ethereum get executed?
  - In the Ethereum blockchain, this means that every contract will exist on every node. If a contract is called, each miner searches their own version of the blockchain and executes the code. If the sender wants to run a long contract, they’re expected to pay for the compute power in Gas. If they don’t pay enough, the transaction won’t be processed. This is how processing transactions will scale in Ethereum. 
- - Why is ethereum going down? Should I sell?
  - Please don’t sell your ether now, because the future for ether is bright, most IOC are using ether as means of raising funds. This will inferably increase demand for ether and price will shoot up. It’s expected for prices of any crypto currencies to rise and fall, just like the stock market it may due to market corrections, regulations, FUD, pump and dump, the list are endless. 
- - Will IOTA still be faster to process transactions in comparison with Bitcoin or Ethereum after Bitcoin implements Lightning Network, and Ethereum implements Raiden Network?
  - Transactions with IOTA can be processed very fast, unordered Commutative Law / Linearity a+b = b+a  and unfiltered because zerovalues are added behind nonzerovalue transactions. There is no maxcount of transactions in one block like in blockchains and there will certainly be no blocksizedebate. Bitcoin implemented with segwit will be able to process more than 20 txs per second. Therefore , IOTA will still be the fastest 
- - How does Waves compare with Ethereum?
  - Waves is just the opposite to ETH probably. What they do is develop Bitcoin scripting, do everything using contracts, it’s very fundamental but makes certain things very complicated. Waves took another road, where things are simpler, very easy to add all functionality you need using plugins, don’t have to code complicated contracts. Also waves focus is on mass adoption, specifically target two markets  fiat transfers on blockchain and crowdfunding on blockchain. They are very ripe for disruption, and waves will be offering a product for a very general audience, basically the main enduser client is just a plugin you can install from Chrome or FF store. 
- - What determines if an Ethereum block is next to another Ethereum block?
  - Basically this is the system. The hash of the previous Ethereum block. 
- - What is the big deal with Tezos? Why not just stick to Ethereum or any other blockchain tech?
  - Why it should stick? Always a new technology will overcome an existing one. Tezos = Upgraded ETH. Just for its initial coin offering, they are sticking with ETH blockchain. They will have their own blockchain soon. Due to some issues, ETHereum is split into ETH and ETC. Because absence of self amending and self governing and authority problem. But in Tezos , if there should be a protocol change, the major stake holders can vote and can approve the change in its portocol. Tezos has a future. 
- - What are the biggest benefits of Ethereum classic over Ethereum? Does it make sense to buy one or both?
  - Eretheum Classic is similar to Gold while Eretheum is similar to dollars. While not perfect I think this a good analogy in terms of how to compare them. Let me explain. The supply of Eretheum Classic is restricted while the supply of Eretheum is not. 
- - What happened to the value of Ethereum that people held in Ethereum exchanges immediately after Ethereums hard fork?
  - You can actually see exactly what happened if you go to Poloniex and check around July 28th, 2016 when ETC was introduced. Here is the value of ETC Ethereum Classic after the hardfork And this is the value of ETH Ethereum immediately after the hardfork The value of ETC shot up and the value of ETH tanked. ETC maxed out at about $3, while ETH hit a low of around $7–8. There was a brief period of time where the market decided that the value of ETC was around 40% of the value of ETH. 
- - What price do people think ethereum will reach?
  - It takes rock bottom to answer this question. I believe that ether org is reaching out to all possible entities as they can, they are doing great events ,promotion ,demonstrations and developments which in result the price of ether would go sky rocket with in no time. As of now, Russia is integrating ether in there banking system as a pilot project, if they find beneficial to there economy then they will go with this fir sure. Ince this happen, ether price will be all the way up… 
- - Is Ethereum similar to Bitcoin?
  - Better read our article for more clarifications and details. Ethereum is similar to Bitcoin in a sense that they both use blockchains. Whereas Bitcoin is solely to be used as a cryptocurrency, Ethereum provides a platform to develop blockchain based applications. Ether ETH is the cryptocurrency on the Ethereum platform. Bitcoin is similar to Ether in the sense that both use the blockchain, but that’s where the similarities end. 
- - Should I buy Ethereum as it has reached nearly £250?
  - Ethereum could be the next big thing! In my opinion Ethereum has the ability to reach $1500 in 3 years, maybe sooner! Why? They have great things coming up , Ethereum is only the coin behind Ethereum foundation who are maintaining the whole Ethereum network. It’s not just a coin , it’s a web 3.0 with a platform to build the next generation apps , called daps. Decentralized Apps. 
- - How does one create a mining rig for Ethereum?
  - You’ll just need a computer and powerful graphics. That’s it and you are ready to mine Ethereum. But make sure you setup the mining rig very powerful. Or the resources will go to waste. If you build a miner which is powerful with strong resources you’ll easily make amazing profits. Ethereum is ASIC resistant that means you cannot use any ASIC to mine ethereum. But, you must use Graphics Cards to mine them. 
- - Is Ethereum dead because CryptoKitties showed that it’s flawed?
  - CryptoKitties, in their gist, are akin to Dogecoin. They did show us that the Internet vastly influences cryptocurrencies and as we all know, this vast place is laden with trolls, anonymous extremists and other unwanted figures. While Dogecoin isnt as malignant as CryptoKitties were, in the sense that they had no tangible power over anything, they did desecrate the good name of cryptocurrencies by their mere existence. 
- - Where can I buy ethereum with INR?
  - You would need to follow this route Please whatever you do, don’t use EthexIndia for anything. It is too new to trust at all. Well if you want to buy Ethereum directly with INR, sorry you have to change your ways. Or maybe there are exchanges which can help you, but even though the demand is high, ETH/INR markets are mostly dead so you have to go alternate way to get ETH. You first of all need to buy BTC from any of the Indian Exchange, personally I only prefer Coinsecure with experience of 1 year. 
- - Is Ripple XRP technology far superior to Ethereum as claimed?
  - I developed a lot of that technology, and I would never claim that it’s superior to Ethereum. Yes, the XRP Ledger can confirm a transaction much faster than Ethereum can and it can perform a much higher number of transactions per second than Ethereum can. By those measures, it’s superior. 
- - Will Ethereum regain value in March 2018?
  - Yes. And I believe in “Market Flippening”. I think Ethereum will be in March #1 by Market Cap, but Bitcoin will regain it’s power after. Let’s see how it will go  
- - Which hashing algorithm and proof algorithm are used in Ethereum?
  - Original question ‘Which hashing algorithm and proof algorithm are used in Ethereum? Ethereum is a complex system that needs miners to make it work. They have several, equally important roles on the Ethereum, or any other type of cryptocurrency network. Ethereum’s tokens are called Ether, and they are created in the process of mining, without involvement of any central instance, like a government or a bank. For every mined block, 5 new Ethers are created. 
- - What is ethereum and how to mine it?
  - What is Ethereum Ethereum is a type of algorithm where instead of mining blocks you earn Ether  a coin that the network runs on. Ethereum was designed as the algorithm for smart contracts, so the way it’s designed makes it very scalable and different from others. How to mine Ethereum Good luck with mining  Ivan 
- - Which one of these can possibly grow faster in the next 12 months, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Neo, or something else on your list?
  - BITCOIN What is Bitcoin? You know what Bitcoin is, stop it. OneYear Simulation OneYear Simulated 1,000 Times Verdict ETHEREUM What is Ethereum? Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference. Ethereum has been busy recently. Multiple steps have been pushed in motion for the upcoming large change — reaching a new consensus method. 
- - Will the price of Ethereum be $1,000 by the end of this year?
  - You never know. It might be huge or it might not. But, it will remain profitable for all. In fact there will be a day when Ethereum will be the most valued cryptocurrency. My personal favorite is Ethereum. Ethereum is high in demand, which is good for traders like me to make good money.

- - Which is more profitable and safe to buy, Bitcoin or Ethereum?
  - If we consider profit then Bitcoin is the only option. Recently I invested in Bitcoins nearly 15 to 20 days back. I bought Bitcoins for 10k. In 10k, I received 0.0319997 Bitcoins. Now, after 15 days if I choose to sale them, then I will receive 10,941₹. So, here is the clear instinct, only in 15 days I am getting 941₹ profit on 10k. But the price is continuously changing, only through some extent. The value of Bitcoins is rising by every day or we can say every hour. Regarding security 
- - As of October 9 2017, why is Bitcoin rising while Litecoin and Ethereum prices are rapidly falling?
  - People are anticipating the Bitcoin Goldfork, and are selling their altcoins including Litecoin, The First Altcoin™ to purchase Bitcoin. Only Bitcoin Gold will be worth just about nothing something in the lines of $100, so good money is wasted on bad money. They probably would have been better off buying more altcoins, instead of getting into the hype. Or not buying BTC right now, which would have saved them hundreds of dollars. “A penny saved is a penny earned” goes for bigger sums too. 
- - Should I purchase Ethereum?
  - You can easily find me on Facebook if you want to learn more about it. Good luck.  I am not an expert, but Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two main cryptocurrencies. Both of them have an enormous potential you can imagine a future where 10% of the transactions are done with cryptocurrencies. So it is a bet, but it can be a very very lucrative bet. Don’t invest you whole money. But invest some money in Ethereum. That all depends, why do you want to buy it? 
- - Is it safe to buy Ethereum by a CEX.IO account?
  - Also, it runs smoothly on it’s IOS app and Web browser platform. However ideally isn’t recommended to store your cryptocurrency on exchanges as those are more prone to hackers / virus or attacks.

- - What actually happens when a Blockchain like Bitcoin or Ethereum forks?
  - Legal counterfeiting Allow me to explain. What happens when Bitcoin or Ethereum fork? Let’s say you have a Benjamin, a Benjie, a Cnote — $100 bill. Your $100 bill is backed by the U.S. government. You don’t know how exactly your Benjie is printed, value controlled, or used in the global economy. Those types of issues are left to a bunch of finance geeks running the Federal Reserve, printing presses, and global trade agreements.

- - Why do people use virtual money like Bitcoin or Ethereum?
  - First, one must understand that Bitcoin and Ethereum are blockchain technology of which Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and Etereum is a smart contract that allows the passageways for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to innovate.

- - Did this CryptoKitties cripple Ethereum? If so, what are the possible outcomes?
  - I recently saw someone on LinkedIn say “The killer app for the blockchain is not tokens, but it is the creation of private economies or ecosystems. Tokens are just enablers to that.” They were disappointed that the first real use of Ethereum was focused on tokens and helping companies raise money, instead of creating ecosystems. Well, maybe they’re in luck, because it turns out that the second killer app is a game with kitties. 
- - Is it worth getting a personal loan to invest in Ethereum?
  - If you think that the rate at which the price of ETH will increase over the duration of the loan exceeds the interest rate on the loan, then, sure, borrowing to buy ETH would make sense. But that’s a big assumption to make. ETH is relatively new and there is very little market history of cryptocurrencies even including BTC with which to make any kind of forecast about future price moves. And I’m ignoring here the dubiousness of predicting future asset prices. 
- - Why is Ethereum currency called gas?

  - Blockchain’s growth in recent years has generated a large number of ICOs for decentralized apps or DAPPs that focus heavily on consumerfacing technology. And yet, many successful blockchain ICOs prioritize the underlying infrastructure instead. There’s a reason for that. The rush of DAPPs is reminiscent of the early internet, where anything with .com behind it was successful. You know, pets .com, books .com, diapers .com. 
- - Which is more profitable to mine - DASH or Ethereum?
  - Dash has code that is similar to Bitcoin. It splits the mining profits between miners, node operators, and infrastructure team. Payouts to the infrastructure team are determined by projects and put to the vote of the node operators. It extends Bitcoin with rapid transactions and privacy through coin mixing using Masternodes. 
- - Can Bitcoin coexist with Ethereum or are they purely competitive?
  - The truth is, as Coinbase/ GDAX’s CEO Fred Ersam wrote Ethereum is in many ways a superset of Bitcoin. And it is in many other ways Version 2.0 of Bitcoin. It learned from Bitcoins mistakes.

- - In times of economical crisis, how will Bitcoin and Ethereum behave?
  - The bubble will pop. If the U.S.A. goes to war with North Korea — and thus brings in China, Russia, and even NATO — the bubble will pop. If banks pull another “Toobigtofail” maneuver and the government must bail them out — which will lead to another global recession — the bubble will pop. If Yellowstone erupts and blankets half the U.S. in ash, or if a truly worldwide cataclysm occurs to sink our economies — the bubble will pop. But which bubble am I talking about? 
- - What will happen to the price of Ethereum after POS?
  - Since nobody knows for sure, anyones guess is as good as yours. That said, it will probably continue to behave normally, mirroring similar up/down trends that we see today under ProofOfWork. As you know, ProofOfStake pays you for setting aside your coins to be used in the validation of transactions. Because of this, there is increased incentive to buy and hold. 
- - What is the growth of Ethereum in 5 months?
  - Difficult to predict about any coin with so much volatility around. Also the new buyers in this space are increasing at a rapid pace along with multiple counties trying to ban crypto trading, makes this difficult to predict anything precisely. But Etherum is a very strong project! It is widely used nowadays, not only as a coin but as a technology. So I am very much bullish on ethereum for 2018. 
- - Does Ethereum have more intrinsic value than Bitcoin?
  - Original question Does Ethereum have more intrinsic value than Bitcoin?

- - If the Ethereum mining difficulty has become so high, does it mean that the Ethereum price will increase too?
  - The price correlation has very little to do with mining difficulty right now. Reason being that cryptocurrencies are in their infancy stage. Currently, the demand is made up of investors trying to get in early to make “millions” and citizens who live in countries with centralized government control such as China. With positive news, negative news, and analytical trend traders in the space, these are only a few of the reasons for the extreme volatility. Because of this, many people and companies remain sceptics. Until crypto can show the world the big advantages, it will remain as such. 
- - How profitable is it to mine Ethereum Classic?

- - Do Ethereum smart contracts have any future?
  - However, many developers are afraid to look into the concept of smart contracts, because smart contracts are fairly fresh and new. Developers have to spend loads of time learning and understanding the key principles.

- - What are the best reasons for buying ethereum?
  - For example, maybe you want to run a crowdfunding campaign as an Ethereum smart contract  but storing code or data on Ethereum is not free, so you have a very good reason to buy Ether to pay for publishing the contract. Or maybe you want to buy a CryptoKitty or parts for an Etherbot or something, in which case again you’ll need Ether, since those are Ethereum dapps and Ether is their preferred currency since this is what is used to pay for invoking their code… it makes sense to use the same currency  if somebody can interact with the program at all, they surely have an Ethereum wallet. 
- - Is it possible that Ethereum and Litecoin will be priced at more than 500$ each?
  - Litecoin has seen its price drop a lot in recent years just like peercoin. Litecoin and peercoin were once #2 and #3 in crypto in terms of market cap.

- - What are NEOs disadvantages in comparison with Ethereum?
  - Adoption. Until all these new coins get adopted as readily as Ethereum is, they won’t be able to overthrow them. NEO, QTUM,IOTA,EOS, LISK is all aiming to dethrone the king. I believe Ether will always have advantage over others in terms of technology despite few drawbacks. Ether has huge mainstream adoption when compared to others. Today Majority of Blockchain operates on Ethereum, for developing tokens or paying gas charges for token wallet transfers.

However, Do not trust my opinion because I am not going to provide you any data for the above statements. 
- - Is it worth mining Ethereum in 2018?
  - 1. Hash rate This is the rate or speed at which the mining work is carried out. The hash rate depends on the mining hardware that is being used whether it is a CPU, GPU or an ASIC miner. Ethereum mining capacity increases with the increased hash rate. ASIC provides the best hash rates. 2. Mining Difficulty 
- - What are the key differences between Ethereum Solidity and Javascript?
  - Ethereum is a public blockchain network. So it cannot be compared to Solidity or Javascript, both of which are programming languages with vastly similar syntax. 
- - What is the best mobile wallet for Ethereum?

- - Should I mine Bitcoin or Ethereum using my GTX 1060? Which software should I use?
  - Mining cryptocurrency with a GPU is like swatting gnats with a sledgehammer. One compute unit CUDA core from an AMD or NVidia GPU has well over a million transistors. So while having 1280 GTX1060 or 4096 Fury X compute units on a GPU might seem phenomenally fast, the wattspercompute unit or the joulesperhash are going to be very high when compared to an extremely fine tuned device like the Antminer s9 which may have hundreds of thousands of extremely simple compute units. 
- - What options do Ethereum based tokens have if Ethereum failed or got massively hacked?
  - None. All the money wrapped up in their ERC20 tokens would evaporate. They could start over on Neo or Lisk, but no one would invest in a company that failed once 
- - Is gas a bad design in ethereum?
  - The network must be secured somehow. Gas is a reward for miners to secure a blockchain. In IOTA the transaction fee, is a proof of work function that signs to previous transactions. The fee is not payed with a coin, but by use of processing power and bandwidth. There is always “gas” payed. In case of ethereum, it’s ether, in case of IOTA, it’s the tiny proof of work expanse, to validate two previous transactions. 
- - If Ethereum has a big crash and if the companies that did ICOs lost money because they were holding Ethereum, then would the token price for those companies drop?
  - No. The price of their coins should still be determined by market dynamics; ie, is the demand and supply of their tokens. The underlying asset price usually and I say ‘usually’ does not determine the price of the derivative asset. [Yes, ideally it should; but it ‘usually’ does not] and hence, the value of these tokens will NOT due to the fall of the underlying asset. 
- - What is the best Ethereum Visa/Mastercard card?

- - What is the most cost-effective graphics card for Ethereum mining as of June 2017?
  - There are a lot of different choices for Ethereum mining GPUs, but a lot of GPUs are overpriced due to demand. One of the best GPUs to choose is the GTX 1070. The 1070 is pretty well priced for it’s 30mh/s hash rate which is pretty good compared to other options in the same price range. I have to warn you, Ethereum mining can be risky. With power costs and the initial amount you invest, you need to be sure you can turn a profit. Use Ethereum mining calculators to make sure it is profitable. 
- - Is EOS better than Ethereum?
  - EOS sacrifices Decentralisation to increase capacity and speed over Ethereum. Only a limited number of nodes participate in the mining process. Hence the latency is limited and the Blocks are synchronised quickly. The nodes are selected by the process of voting. DPoS  Delegated Proof of Stake.

Cardanos blockchain is similar to Ethereums mirroring the fact that decentralised applications DAPS and smart contracts can be built on the blockchain. However Cardano focuses on a few fundamental elements 
- - Should I convert all my Bitcoin to Ethereum?
  - How you phrase your question is key to getting an answer you are looking for. “Should” is looking for outside guidance on YOUR question. This is my personal opinion and this is due to Part of the fun with the crpytospace, is outside of computer programmers, most people getting into cryptocurrency know little about the space. People have their own understandings of technology, money, and leveraging infrastructure. 
- - Is it better to buy Factom coin or Ethereum Classic?
  - Ethereum Classic to my opinion. This blockchain faced some heavy difficulties in the past but was able to overcome the crisis and create more business value then any other crypto currency while still being immutable! They not create a new bank when it went wrong but just secured the bank and spread the damage. 
- - Why does the price of ethereum drop?
  - when ICOs move money to the exchanges this triggers further selling. Because people can see a large amount of ETH being moved into the exchange. If they couldnt tell how much or from who was moving them onto the exchange then this action wouldnt trigger the sell off. Then the ICO people could sell and that would effect the market for sure but you wouldnt get the speculation. It is about supply and demand , basic Econ 101, if you dump a large amount for supply into the market, it will increase the supply shifting the supply curve to the right and thus depressing prices. 
- - What is the best ethereum exchange?
  - You can’t really find “the best one”. Every exchange has it’s good and bad sides so it is probably best to see which one has the lowest fees depending on your country.

Again, go through the deposit and withdraw fees and check every little detail before you deposit your money on an exchange. You might end up paying a lot when trying to get it back.

- - Will the Plasma concept be enough to solve the scaling problems of Ethereum?
  - no, the technology we house mid 2017 is not enough to upscale this yet. It is coming, i think there is more exciting news at end of year in this space. If you want a currency that will scale, use IOTA. Sadly though, IOTA does not support contracts, so there is still a need to fix ETH to scale.. 
- - Is this view on Ethereums vulnerability correct?
  - The smart contract would have to be very very complex or at lest very lengthy for it to stay in the Etherium network to be continually worked on. Thats why simple transactions and contracts cost a small amount of gas while larger and more complex transactions and contracts take a larger amount of gas. 
- - Why does Bruce Fenton think Ethereum is going higher than Bitcoin, if he thinks Bitcoin is a superior blockchain?
  - To my understanding cryptocurrencies are merely distributed ledgers. So they are a means of documenting transactions among market participants. The superiority of Bitcoin might be purely technical, because it seemingly is anonymous. Ethereum is additionally useful in linking monetary transactions within the blockchain to legally enforceable contracts in the real world.

  - Cryptocurrency is a very new concept and not even a decade old. Due to this early adoption with barely any regulations in place, there are more than 500 currencies in the market.

Having said this, the novel concept has given rise to competitions like Bitcoin and Ether and Ripple and Litecoin and Golem and Dash and many others. Thank you.1 View 
- - What are Ethereums competitors?
  - Oh, how things have changed. A lot of competitors right now, and most of them have a decent chance of winning. Personally, Im betting on Waves because It has a builtin decentralized exchange with great volume. BTC is the closest one. Competitors are other smart contract blockchains nem, nxt, waves, lisk and plenty of new ones coming. But Ethereum is well positioned as the undisputed leader so competitors will mostly die off or be left in irrelevance. 
- - Is Ethereum mining an inefficient use of processing power?
  - Yes mining in general is not an efficient use of power. That is why there is talk about moving Ethereum from POW to POS. But if that happened, there would be hard fork which no one wants to see since one already happened. That is why there is a Ethereum Classic and Ethereum. In most cases yes it is! In the future there will be better solutions imo. Here is an article that might help you better. What is POI verses POW and why it is better, and what is vesting. 
- - How do I become an Ethereum developer? I am a Java Senior developer and I would like to start with developing Ethereum applications. What is the best way to start?
  - When you hear anybody tell you that it’s just some manageable extrapolation from skills you already have, run like the wind. Or that you can just take some contracts you find and dick around with them. Ethereum is the Wild West, even from the developer standpoint. Everything you already know is turned on its head and inside out. The people who will end up making the money in this kind of development will be crack and super creative. 
- - The global GDP is 70 trillion. Ethereum valuation is at 30B. What should be Ethereums valuation in 3 years?
  - Simply put, GDP is the value of the goods and services produced in the last year. A global GDP of $70 trillion means that last year, all the human beings combined produced goods and services, the value of which totaled to $70 trillion. The combined wealth of the world will be immensely larger than the $70 trillion. There is no sure fire way of coming to a relatively accurate estimation wealth unlike GDP. 
- - Can technical analysis be used on Ethereum trading, why?
  - I want to show you two pictures, one is the the ES SandP emini futures contract the other is an ETHUSD pair. Out of the two, the ES is one the most traded instruments on the planet. Etherium is still relatively new and doesn’t really come close to the trading volume of the leader of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin. But just from looking at these charts, you probably couldn’t tell which is which. No volume to show you, no price scale. Just some candlesticks. These are daily candlesticks. Still can’t tell? 
- - Which one is a better investment - Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple for very short term?
  - Ive been researching crypto for a year and a half already not a very long term though enough to make up my mind about the crypto market. Still I urge you to do your own research and do not take my advice for granted. I would definitely advice you to stay away from Ripple which is a banking technology and not a cryptocurrency in reality centralized by banks, regulated network. Definitely Litecoin, same as I said a year ago, Id repeat again, is undervalued even now. 
- - Are EOS or Ardor worthy investments for 2018? Can they outpace Ethereum?
  - EOS is not meant to be a coin to invest in as said directly on their website... They even go as far as saying Americans can’t be buying the coin and deny access to them directly on their site. That being said, EOS is a great technology with their roadmap being set for major smart contract innovation. They are using web assembly as their programming language contrary to Ethereum’s solidity language making it much easier to start writing programs for the EOS chain. 
- - Is it economical to mine Ethereum?
  - It depends on your processing power and cost of electricity. Yes. I am doing so now and still make good returns, even after the recent fall. 
- - Is it a good time to exchange Bitcoin with Ethereum?
  - I recently sold all my BTC and LTC to fiat with a very good profit. I do not invest much, during a financial bubble. I still HODL ETH, because of I use it every day, and it is critical need to me. I also believe that Raiden Network/Plasma protocol will help solve current scability problems of the blockchain. 
- - Do you think Ethereum is facing downtrend to $180?
  - I see no sign of it happening. Why $180? Where did you get this number? Did anyone conjure it up? Three things You will have a much better answer 
- - What correlation are Ethereum and Bitcoin currently realising?
  - I wouldn’t say so. If you take a look at the price of ETH as it’s pegged to BTC, you’ll see that ETH has been slowly losing BTC value. Here’s what the last ~12 months have looked like for Ethereum. With BTC being so volatile, I think the market is still making up it’s mind onwhat the new BTC pegs should be. ETH was sitting around ~.05 BTC for the last few months, but now it’s moving around some more. We’ll have to wait for BTC to stabilize before we know what the new ETH/BTC value looks like. 
- - How does forking work on Ethereum?
  - Forking Hard Fork Hard Fork is usually done only when there is enough support from the mining community. Only when the majority of miners give positive signal towards the upgrade or fork, the developers of the chain starts work on the upgraded code. Typically, the support should come from 90 to 95 percent of the miners. Soft Fork 
- - Is there any impact on Ethereum, with Segwit and Bitcoin?
  - As u know Bitcoin is crashing down and basic way is to buy ethereum and other alt coins is to buy Bitcoin first. The reason is Bitcoin is unstable for next few days and this uncertainty is applicable to other coins. That is the main reason. One u have to understand that Bitcoin is mother currency. All other alt coins are based on Bitcoin u can buy them through Bitcoin and if u sell u get get Bitcoin against them. If Bitcoin affects then all other alt coins also affected. So ehterioum and other alt coins has indirect connection with it. Experts are saying ethereum will go down under 100 USD. 
- - Is Koinex one of the good and reliable exchanges for buying Ethereum?
  - yes at present koinex is good and reliable exchange for buying etherum, apart from etherum you can also buy other cryptocurrency like litecoin, ripple, bitcoincash etc. From my personal use I am telling you . Their service and platform is very good, price rate difference is low, bidding feature and lots more Plus they have a good team looking for future growth. Though do your own research properly before investing your money. For joining bonus and referral you can follow below link and refer code. 
- - What happens to an Ethereum based token if Ethereum itself hard forks?
  - This is an excellent question, although nothing much would happen. The Ethereum based ERC20 tokens like the hundreds of other altcoins will continue to work as usual on the old blockchain while the new ones will simply have duplicate addresses and Ether from the old blockchain while having none of the other information in subsequent blocks. You will have tokens on each blockchain. You can think of a hard fork as a duplication of a database with a different set of consensus rules. 
- - Is ethereum entering bubble territory?
  - Thank you for requesting my answer to this question! It’s natural to ask this question, especially as the value of ethereum is skyrocketing. Personally, I feel ethereum has too much going for it to fall into that category of being in a bubble. BUT, I do believe that we’ll see a correction in its value before it pushes on value wise. 
- - When should I reinvest my money into Ethereum?
  - There are two types of trading styles, long term and short term. If you are investing in ETH long term then just buy whenever, buy right now, buy tommorow it doesnt really matter. Then you hold no matter what. Even if it crashes on August, even if it crashes on Septemper, you hold. After a few years you sell when you had enough with all these profits. 
- - What is the best book for developing private blockchain in ethereum?
  - Mastering Blockchain  Second Edition Read chapters on Ethereum. It covers in detail how to build private network using Ethereum and then develop, test and deploy on private Ethereum network. 
- - How easy is to mine ethereum and is it still worth doing so?
  - Mining Ethereum is pretty easy. You just need to build your rig and then run the miner. The question you should be asking is, is it profitable? Well, it can be. If you choose a good GPU and make sure it is profitable in your area local power cost then buying a rig and mining Ethereum can be a great investment. You need to watch for the hash rate, the power consumption, and of course the initial cost of the GPUs. 
- - What are the price predictions for Ethereum in the coming 2 months?
  - Thats like saying how many fish will I catch when I go fishing tonight! No body is psychic!? In the next two months we have Segwit, Bitcoin descicions, we have failing icos , and panicked investors selling! My best guess is the next two months will require helmets with chin straps attached ie  very volatile swings especially on the Segwit dates Aug 1st ... So strap yourself in! 
- - Why are Ripple and Ethereum dropping? Is it still a good idea to invest in this?
  - Coming to your question. Over the last few days, the massive crash in the crypto market has equally affected more than 90% of the available cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether and Ripple. Why? Since the prices are dropping big time, is it a good time to begin investments? 
- - Do I invest in Ethereum or Litecoin for a long-term investment?
  - If you HAVE to put money in either, pick the one with the larger market capitalization. Larger cap = more volume = more liquidity + smaller spreads = less chance of you taking an even bigger hair cut when you realize that highly speculative investments were a bad idea…. ethereum. litecoin is just a coin. ethereum is a platform for building decentralised applications, all of which require ether to run, thus creating demand from commercial applications. litecoin has demand only from speculation 
- - Will Ripple XRP or Ethereum ETH topple Bitcoin BTC at the top?
  - Ripple XRP and Ethereum ETH are undoubtedly one of the most stable cryptocurrencies as well as the most famous altcoins. Bitcoin, being the most wellknown and influential cryptocurrency, is responsible for the individual price and market capitalization of other altcoins. 
- - Will Ethereum boom again like it did earlier this year?
  - Everything is possible, however I personally doubt it for the following reasons 
- - Why is NEO considered to be better than Ethereum?
  - NEO “Chinese Ethereum” can be programmed in many languages while Ethereum can only use Solidity ——— Content Director for Cryptosomniac Cryptocurrencies Educator and Analyst Can we even make a comparison at this point? I know Ethereum is still technically in development, but it’s had a lot longer to mature than NEO, which is still a very nascent technology. I don’t think we’ll get to answer this question properly until a year from now. 
- - What is the expected growth value of Ethereum and LiteCoin cryptovalue?
  - And now comes to Ethereum.. I hope I’ve helped you, bye. If u want more info, then click on below name to follow and see the magic.. Rudraksh Kapoor Its very difficult to tell the exact time when a coin is going to rise and what will be reason. Cryptocurrecnies are volatile and their prices fluctuates a lot. But it’s highly unlikely that it will disappear suddenly. It’s dollar value may decrease. 
- - Why is the Ethereum price going up these two days?
  - Ethereum and the classics go hand and foot above any other digital value in the industry right now and will still. Ethereum is the most classic of them all. It is backed by a useful technology other cryptocurrencies depend on to sustain, develop, and grow their core companies. It is part of the original big 3 of cryptocurrency along with BitcoinCash and LITECOIN. It should be around $1000 later this year is a given is only a personal valuation by me based on market performance earlier year and believing in ‘THE ETHEREUM BRAND. I think skys the limit with ETHER because the founder is a Russian Crypto Genius who has a history of original ideas that have and will continue to advance forward the industry into the resurrection of crypto no coins allowed. 
- - Is it a good strategy to buy Ethereum with Bitcoin while the price is down?
  - Here is a bit general answer to that question, you will easily have your answer as well with a bit of analogy. Day trading vs. Position trading. If you choose to day trade, you better be good  avoid day trading unless you already have such a skill mastered through the regular stock market Position trading, using research plus tech analysis, and establishing your parameters for taking profits and sticking to them is easier for a beginner/medium level trader. 
- - What will be the effect of Ethereum Zero fork on the Ripple price?
  - Ethereum zeroETZ fork is about to take place on 19th January, 2018. People who will hold Ethereum will get equivalent amount of Etz in their wallet. Now their might not be much impact on the price of Ripple due to this. By price I mean in regards to USD or INR. However there might be a slight decline in the price in regards to ETH. 
- - What is Lisk, and how is it different than Ethereum?
  - Lisk is a public block chain platform that provides decentralized block chain apps main difference between Lisk and Ethereum in my opinion is that Eth project has many bankers and whales behind it, supporting its advertising campaign with millions of dollars and also use that money to manipulate the price of it while those behind Lisk dont have any of it! 
- - Why cant Apple accept Bitcoin/Ethereum?
  - Bitcoin and Ethereum both have a lot of technical hurdles they must get past in order to be used effectively in mass market. The scaling issue is the most notable, and it’s being worked on actively. Bitcoin’s solution is called Lightning Network, and Ethereum’s solution is called Raiden Network. If they are truly successful, then you may see cryptocurrency get added as an option within Apple pay someday. 
- - Is NEO poised to become the next Ethereum? Does the underlying technology justify its price right now?
  - Neo is based out of China and seems to have the backing of the Chinese government. That is a huge plus. As you may have heard, China likes to block large foreign IT companies out of China and create copy cats. For example, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat are all not accessible within China. Someday China might decide to do the same thing with Bitcoin or Ethereum. Who knows? 
- - Will Ethereum recover after the recent and ongoing price drop?
  - Yes. Ethereum’s price is affected by bitcoin’s fork and the price will be quite jumpy until the dust settles down in the other camp. I think that ETH’s price will be trending around its original ATH around around September / October this year. That’s more or less when we find out whether bitcoin is hardforking or not. After that, we hodl until we reach the moon  
- - Should I use Ethereum or MultiChain to build my own private blockchain?
  - It depends entirely on what exactly is the purpose of your blockchain. In most cases, when you have Bitcoinstyle transactions asset creation, transfer, escrow, exchange and destruction, MultiChain is the way to go. Ethereum is for Smart Contracts. You store code scripts and all modifications to the code and data are performed according to the contract. 
- - Is it possible that Ethereum can go down past $100 in the next 4 weeks?
  - As others have said this is so extremely unlikely. It would take a real slash of Ethereum’s Achilles heal if it has one to see an Ether price that low. There are many reasons for that unlikelihood so allow me to touch on each briefly, in no particular order So anyways, by now you’re probably saying “OK, stop sucking up to Ether.” Well allow me to explain what could make the price fall to near or even below $100 levels 
- - What was the price of Ethereum at launching?
  - The Ethereum ICO was the second ICO ever and took place during 42 days 22 July 2014 – 2 September 2014. The Ethereum ICO collected 31,500 Bitcoins that at the time was worth approximately 18,400,000 USD. If you bought 100 Ethereum at the time of the ICO, they would have set you back roughly 30 USD. At the alltime high on 13 January 2018, 100 Ethereum was worth roughly 140,000 USD… 
- - Do you think Ethereum will spike through $400?
  - Yes. Heres why. Even though ETH is widely known within the crypto currency ecosystem as an alternative investment, the digital coin positions itself to offer a different set of technology known as smart contracts. Smart contracts will create new forms of financial products. These new financial products among hundreds and thousands within the crypto currency world will eventually replace paper currency known today. Ethereum is working with Russian Banking . 
- - Who has a better developer community, Bitcoin or Ethereum?
  - “Better” is subjective, of course. The reason for these differences are inherent, based on the scope of the Bitcoin blockchain, and the scope of the Ethereum blockchain “Bitcoin and Ethereum differ in purpose. While Bitcoin is created as an alternative to regular money and is thus a medium of payment transaction and store of value, Ethereum is developed as a platform which facilitates peertopeer contracts and applications via its own currency vehicle. 
- - What are the best wallets for buying Bitcoin and Ethereum in INR Indian rupees?
  - I have been using the below mentioned sites for about 2 years now. Here are few basics about wallet, an exchange and a brokers. Now, There are few exchanges and a lot of broker platforms out there to buy bitcoins. But for ethereum there are only few. The exchanges where you can buy both are only two Coindelta and Koinex. You can compare the two by yourself. 
- - Why do people still use Ethereum Classic?
  - The reasons to use Ethereum Classic are mainly ideological. If one believes in the underlying technology of Ethereum but does not agree the decision of the Ethereum dev team to roll back the blockchain after the DAO hack, then one would likely continue to use Ethereum Classic. If one believes that immutability is a fundamental principle of what makes a blockchain secure and valuable then one will likely continue to use Ethereum Classic. 
- - What do you think about investing in Ripple? Do you think Lisk poses a danger to Ethereum? Should bitcoin or ethereum be bought for 1-2 year?
  - You asked like three questions, which is sort of cheating. But here are your answers Its to early in the game to make predictions. Bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin are the leaders, stay with them for now . My rationale is this  coinbase makes a market on these three only. Why? Well to operate in New York, the most lucrative market on the planet and also the most regulated, they needed to vet and find the most legitimate assets to trade. BTC, ETH, LTC.. 
- - How much more will Ethereum gain anticipating the fork on the 19th and what are your predictions for Ethereums 2018 performance?
  - I don’t know but Ethereum is very bullish for some time now. I hope it doesn’t skyrocket too much as I have little left for now, being in many alts. We will see. I presume 0.1 in BTC price for 1 Ether is a reasonable prediction. That is around 1.500–1.700. Hello, Jacob! 
- - Does it make sense to invest in a cryptocurrency like Golem, if its bought with Ethereum? Wouldnt one just invest in Ethereum then?
  - Good question. Id say it all depends on everyones investment style. Ethereum would eventually continue to grow and appreciate for the following reasons That said, those that are looking for a steady growth do buy Ethereum and hold it. Others who believe in the potential of new emerging coins, buy/trade Ethereum to invest in those coins hoping for a massive ROI. Disclaimer This is not a financial advice. 
- - Why does it cost ether to run blockchain program in ethereum? Does an Ethereum clone that doesnt require ether money render ethereum useless?
  - Many people think that internet is free. They dont understand that there is no free lunch. All these free services collect their data and sell them. So all the free services offered target you as the product. You and your data are the product they sell.  There could not be an Ethereum clone without ether, because computing power costs and network bandwidth costs and electricity costs. Why should I run a node, without any gain? So an ethereum clone will not have life at all, because there is no reason for the miners to participate. 
- - What is the best software wallet for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin?
  - It depends what you mean by “Best”. I will assume you mean safest Wallet. I have many different wallets on many different exchanges for many different reasons. If you are just getting into Cryptocurrency then go with the one that is the easiest to understand and is largely considered one of the safest on the web. Coinbase. Coinbase is an excellent way to get into cryptocurrency without ever really having to learn what or how crypto operates. Coinbase deals with only 3 types of crypto out of literally thousands of choices. You’ll like the beginner feel that it has to it as well. It makes it easy to purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin using your bank account, debit card, and credit cards. One of the few that offers the last one as an option I might add! Here’s the downside… Their fees. You can shop the net and find a cheaper alternative than Coinbase for sure. However the click to buy interface gets lost on a lot of the other sites. Coinbase does charge handsomely for their Ease Of Use.. The following is cut and pasted from their homepage to show you how confusing some of this can get 
- - Is Ethereum or Cardano better to hold for the duration of 2018?
  - I personally like both. That being said, Cardano has a much longer roadmap until its production ready. In the meantime, faults and all, Ethereum is already operating in the wild. Here is a little write up I did explaining what Cardano is all about 
- - Which is best platform for beginner level programmers in Python/JavaScript to learn the blockchain technology of Ethereum/Hyperledger Fabric? Where can one get the material and tutorials?
  - With knowledge of Solidity, writing SmartContractchaincode in Fabric won’t be a big thing. You can choose either Go or JS to write chaincode and it is far easier to implement the logic. You can check our articles about Hyperledger Fabric’s mysteries. Hahaha JK. There are very good articles that explains things in very elegant way. Which is best platform for beginner level programmers in Python/JavaScript to learn the blockchain technology of Ethereum/Hyperledger Fabric? 
- - Why isnt the price of ETH Ethereum as volatile and explosive as that of Bitcoin?
  - A few main reasons Bitcoin has had many hard forks over the past couple of months, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold and recently Segwit2x I’m aware this was cancelled but its relevant. Whenever a hard fork is announced, investors put their money into BTC to receive their proportionate amount in the new forked coin. Once the fork has taken place, the investors then sell their BTC and invest in altcoins again. 
- - Which famous cryptocoin is probably not able to survive with time, IOTA or Ethereum?
  - At the moment, the biggest technical issue with Bitcoin is scalability  the 1mb block size limits the number of transactions per second. The Bitcoin Lightning crowd wants a work around that doesn’t validate small transactions; the Bitcoin Cash crowd wants a larger block size. Additionally, Ethereum, Ripple and IOTA all have centralized governance or at least leadership and decisionmaking behind them, unlike the free for all that’s taken over the Bitcoin community. 
- - Is Ethereum anonymous?
  - In what sense? This is a very broad question if you can clarify you will get a much better answer. No. Ethereum was developed by Vitalik Buterin Meet Vitalik Buterin, the 23yearold founder of bitcoin rival ethereum Shawn Murphy 
- - Will ethereum increase in value?
  - The short answer is yes, the timeframe is unknown. There are still lots of updates being worked on for Ethereum such as Casper that will turn ETH from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake. That means coins will no longer be mined by GPUs and instead only be minted by holding coins. Metropolis which will help with the scalability issue we saw recently during some of the ICOs slowing down the network. Don’t think so short term, keep buying the dip if you can. 
- - What file type is the ethereum blockchain?
  - Blockchains are not file types. They are ledgers, that reside on the network, and all participating nodes, have a copy of the blockchain on their system, to mine and confirm transactions. Ethereum blockchain, is something special. The software that reads it, has the ability to execute code, that is contained in the blockchain blocks. No file type at all. 
- - What are the best IDEs for Ethereum developers?
  - If you are a beginner who wants to learn how to write smart contracts in Ethereum using solidity. Then you may try the following However you try any of these alternatives with given extensions  Personally, I just use Visual studio code with solidity extension which helps me to format and check the code for errors, I then move that code to Remix solidity browser. Note Even I am learning how to develop dapps using solidity. If anyone has more /better suggestions. Please feel free to mention. 
- - What kind of data is stored in the Ethereum blockchain?
  - In the Ethereum blockchain are stored algorithms that can be accessed by linking smart contracts to them. 
- - Ethereum is going down heavily. When will it be a good time to put in that?
  - The best advice I got for that is invest half of what you want to invest in cryptocurrency and other half when the market goes down further. The market will always will be volatile. In the recent bull run, the price shot up in a day. So the opportunity is there and will not be there in a day. 
- - Do you believe that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin have a good future. Why?
  - I will answer one by one 1.Litecoin Bitcoin network is offering a bad really bad user experience. Transactions cost more than several banks and take ages to be confirmed. Sure, you can pay 1015$ of fees and see your transaction be confirmed in few minutes, but is it normal? Obviously no. 
- - What is the best website to buy Ethereum in Hong Kong?
  - Try Binance Buy Bitcoin and other crypto currencies/tokens directly from people Local Bitcoins Buy Bitcoin and other crypto currencies with credit/debit cards Coin Mama I would try Bitpanda or CEXIO. 
- - Is Coinbase a secure place to store my Ethereum?
  - No, Coinbase is not a secure place to store your Ethereum. No. They may have great security in place but they’re still a centralized exchange and store all the private keys in a database. This makes them vulnerable to hackers, especially since they have millions stored in their wallets. I can’t predict if they will get hacked, but there is always a possibility. I have seen a couple of posts on people losing money on coinbase. 
- - What’s the most interesting use case for Ethereum?
  - Using smart contracts to pay song writers for royalties automatically. 
- - When is Ethereum going to hit ATH again?
  - It should happen soon, before end of 2017, especially considering the amazing ascent of Bitcoin, after a supposedly busted parabolic rise to a previous AllTimeHigh ATH. In that respect, Ehereum chart is almost begging for a new ATH to supposedly validate Bitcoin leadership. 
- - What is the difference between Ethereum Ripple and Bitcoin?
  - The battle between the three types of cryptocurrencies can be fought in four major rounds 1. The Speed of Transaction It will be surprising but the truth remains that Ripple is the winner of this round outshining both its opponents; Bitcoin and Ethereum. The transaction speed of Ripple is mere 4 seconds as compared to a long waiting 40 minutes in the case of bitcoin and 2 minutes in ethereum. 2. Scalability 
- - What will be the fate of Ethereum in 2018 following the show BTC is putting on?
  - If Ethereum and Bitcoin were college students Bitcoin is having a graduation party right now with some pals. He graduated with a bachelor in liberal arts and it took him 7 years to finish it. He was supported by daddy during that period. No one thought he could do it but he made it! Ethereum is a little busy right now writing a PhD thesis on cryptocurrency economic development. previously answered question 
- - Is it likely that Ethereum will reach $2,000 in 2018?
  - Nobody has any idea of the evolution of the price of Ethereum. But, personally, I think it is the cryptocurrency with the most potential. I think Ethereum will reach $2000 in 2018. Probably Q1 2018. Smart contracts are a true killer feature. Something that can change the world. Nobody has any idea of all the possible applications of a such disruptive technology. We have seen p2p loans, digital decentralized autonomous organization DAO, and ICOs, but it is only the beginning. 
- - What must you do to mine Ethereum?
  - All you have to do is start building out mining rigs which are basically computers with 5–7 GPUs attached to them. You’ll need the basics to get it running and mining. You can assemble a Ethereum mining farm fairly simple in your basement or in the garage! Plus getting it all setup is pretty fun. all you need is a profitable ethereum mining services. 
- - Why is the price of ethereum not moving compared to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that are rising?
  - There are several dimensions that could be given to answer this. However the basics are same. Demand and supply is the very basic thing for any commodity or anything of a value to go up or down. Crypto currency is not an exception for this rule. 
- - How do I buy Ethereum in India? I only use a Zebpay wallet currently.
  - Koinex  you can use to buy Ethereum with people growing interest in cryptocurrency, altcoins like ethereum, ripple, litecoin, etc getting popular among people. “Its the best time to invest in Ripple and litecoin as from past 1 week its growing and giving huge return”…… Mostly people use Zebpay but problem is it only allow trading of bitcoin. No other cryptocurrency, plus there charge of bitcoin is also high as compare to international market, buying and selling price difference is high. 
- - Is there any reason to use your own blockchain, as opposed to Ethereum, for an ICO?
  - Sure, if you have a specific use case that can’t be easily fulfilled by another platform. The reason why people are using Ethereum to run their application is There are other platforms such as WAVES. Or you can even use dual Waves/Ethereum. 
- - How can I build a solar powered Ethereum mining rig?
  - 5000 / 24 hours = 208.3 W/m^2 To summarize, you need about 8–10 square meters of solar panels with some good power storage system. Can you build a solar powered Ethereum mining rig? Of course. Should you build a solar powered Ethereum mining rig? Probably not unless you are living in a very sunny and warm climate such as a desert like in Arizona, Nevada, the Middle East or north Africa. Otherwise, you will have a very hard time making a profit given the cost of your panels and power storage. 
- - What is the scope of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple in 2018?
  - I personally don’t invest in bitcoin, Because Ethereum is more profitable. Bitcoins value is high, and it is not much profitable for traders and short term investors. Invest in Ethereum instead. Most of the people think that Ethereum trading is difficult. But, the fact is, it is not a complicated process. The only thing you’ll require is a consistent watch on the Ethereum price charts. 
- - Which is better, buy one Bitcoin or the equivalent in Ethereum now? I can risk 2.5K.
  - Ethereum is behaving in the same way Bitcoin did in 2013–14. Bitcoin had its Mt Gox hacking and Silver road trials, now Ethereum has its huge ICOs deploying ethers like mad because they need sufficient funding for the next 2–3 years as well as the CoinDash hack. 
- - Can I buy part of an Ethereum coin?
  - You can buy 0.00000001 Eth and that is fine as long as someone is willing to sell and transact that amount. However most exchanges have a withdrawal fee or a minimum amount and moving Eth comes with a gas fee, so it makes sense to buy more than 0.00000001 Eth but thats certainly possible. Absolutely! Almost all the coins are divisible by 10^8; meaning 0.00000001Eth is the least amount of ethereum except otherwise stated. You can buy 0.01eth or 0.1eth as you wish. 
- - Which coin is the best store of value, Bitcoin or Ethereum?
  - An asset is a good store of value if it maintains similar levels of usefulness with the passage of time. Traditional store of value assets have underlying utility value that forms a backbone for their overall value. Gold has underlying utility value in applications such as semiconductors and jewelry. Real estate has underlying value for building, farming, and mining, among others. 
- - How is Ethereum priced like a currency? Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is not meant to be a currency but a platform for smart contracts.
  - Ethereum is not a currency. It is a blockchain platform to run smart contracts as they are coded to be. You can build your dapps and write smart contracts and run on Ethereum network. Ethereum has removes the need of making a new blockchain for every different business use cases. Instead developers and companies can use Ethereum network directly run codes over it. 
- - Ethereum has fallen to $790 as of February 2, 2018. What is happening?
  - Next, the entire market suffered losses because of Tether, which is another cryptocurrency that is believed to be manipulative after the Bitfinex exchange received a subpoena by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. As you can see, the drop in the price is most likely a result of lots of bad news and a lot of media coverage in a bad way. As much negative news pile up for the market, the market will continue to look unattractive. 
- - Is it beneficial to invest in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum?
  - No really too sure on how to properly answer this question. There are definitely many speculators in the market trying to make a quick buck out of it. In terms of utility, something like bitcoin only serve as a storage of value. But with the volatility, its too big a risk right now. If you are looking for something that is made for a better purpose. Try coins like tron or Miota. 
- - How can I buy and store Ethereum cryptocurrency, and is it likely to gain in value?
  - The first part of your question is easy! Buy Store Its important to not store your ether in an exchange long term. They are not secure may be compromised. If their servers go down, you lose access to your coin. Price It is likely to gain in value long term, but it is still very high risk and anything could change.

  - Friend of mine knows Vitalik a little and she rates him highly. I haven’t written anything serious  just downloaded the IDE and played around quickly with Solidity.

That’s the least interesting observation to make  it’s not the weaknesses of ethereum that are interesting, but its strengths.

  - Coinbase only allows you to buy BTC/ETH/LTC. If you want to buy other coins, you’ll have to use multiple exchanges.

  - There will be one Ethereum chain, with major preparations for the Proof of Stake transition coming up later this year. There are a few changes being made here Ultimately, this is to ‘nudge’ the miners into accepting that the Ethereum Network will be moving to POS.

You only use it on the first day, then you ditch it.

- - Is investing in cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin or Ethereum worth it?
  - Maybe. It will be higher risk with higher potential reward. To be clear, even BTC/ETH is fairly risky but IMO those two are the best way to get exposure into cryptocurrencies atm. If you want to branch out a bit, might be good to check out LTC, DASH, IOTA. Those are ones that I hold small amounts of. They are speculative bets for the long future. 
- - What is the biggest potential vulnerability/risk of the ethereum blockchain?
  - Essentially it is confidence in the tech. where not enough people believe Eth will be useful in the real world that not many will make applications for it and therefore users will not be able to use their coins. and conversely, users will not buy into the currency if there are not much use for it. Additionally, there can also be risks on scams/ ICOs that people accumulate ETH en masse that others just decide they had unfair advantage and don’t want to play with them anymore and therefore look for another cryptosubstitute. this is relatively lowrisk and not many people talk about it but it is there. imagine central bank discuss crypto in their back offices and say how they’re late in the game and other people have more in their stash than they do would they still want to play or follow Japan’s move and make their own? 
- - Is ethereum, at its current price of $200, a good investment?

- - Would you recommend joining Ethereum ICO?
  - This question is poorly formulated. The Ethereum crowdsale around the DAO happened in May 2016, so you missed the boat for that. If you simply mean getting involved in purchasing tokens from any ICO built on the Ethereum blockchain, that depends entirely on what the ICO is for and the project behind it. 
- - Is there a correlation between Twitter sentiment and the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum?
  - Yes there most definitely is. Given that the Bitcoin market or any other alt coin market, is small relative to that of a more traditional market forex etc, the price can in many ways be manipulated.

- - What is Ethereum used for?
  - You can create smart contracts on Ethereum. Smart contracts make it possible for you to exchange anything of value.

- - Is Loom Network the next Ethereum?
  - Original question ‘Is Loom Network the next Ethereum?’ 
- - Why is the price of Ethereum falling? It reached to $160 now.
  - The biggest reason why there is “fear” or “uncertainty” at this point is due to SegWit and August 1st. People are fearful that a hard fork will come soon after that. But unlike Bitcoin that only had 100% rise in price over the last few months, Ethereum and others saw 1000–2000% rise in price. 
- - How are virtual kittens bogging down Ethereum?
  - There aren’t. Hell no, that’s innovation. Granted, it’s not the most useful side, but people find value in it, and that’s why it’s a thing. Cryptokitties shows that you can use Ethereum for more than just currency. You can create games with Ethereum as a central technology. It shows that MMORPGs could have actual currency involved in the future. Your WoW guild could get rich in the future, but you will probably just make a few dollars while you play. 
- - Whats your favorite wallets to store Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple? Why?
  - Follow me if you are interested in Blockchain and Cryptos. Coinpayments.net. Benefits The following are some of the cryptocurrencies supported by CoinPayments I started using CoinPayments a few months ago when I first brought Bitcoin worth about $60 using Coinmama.I waited long enough to get started into this exciting world hoping one day, I would be able to make a huge sum of money too. Although I started with a small sum of money, it was my first step. You see the benefits there? 
- - How can I pay bills with Ether/Ethereum, Ethereum, ETC, or ETH?
  - Disclosure I have used this answer before 
- - Why is GDAX covering the losses of the Ethereum crash?
  - But its worth to mention that they had a lot of complaints with no or little automatic responses from their support to people who lost much more money totally than what they are reimbursing through their GDAX while their service on Coinbase was down for a few days many times already. With them going out of service exactly when prices started dropping. My guess, they want their GDAX have a better reputation in contrast to their own. 
- - How will Bitcoin being in the stock market effect Ethereum in the future?
  - There are some efforts to create Bitcoinbacked instruments so people used to trading on traditional exchanges and don’t know how to setup wallets and care about digital security can have an easier time investing, but they kind of miss the point of Bitcoin and I don’t think will exist after people learn how Bitcoin works. Why pay the cost of playing by someone else’s rules when you can just do it without permission? 
- - What are the highest price predictions for Ethereum coins?
  - We cannot predict where exactly Ethereum will be. But, it’s definite that Ethereum will rise above and will be priced high. I trade using Ethereum, investing thousands everyday.

  - EDIT There are no guarantees when investing in cryptocurrency, don’t invest money you’re not willing to lose. Yes, there are some coin that really good to invest I choose this coin because some reason such as Crypto currency is nothing more than a speculative bubble. Your very question brings into mind the tulip bubble seen a few centuries before. 
- - Why use the existing Ethereum public blockchain when creating a token and not fork Ethereum and have your own public blockchain with dedicated miners, etc?
  - Great question! Not only do you need to convince miners that it’s worth their hardware / time / effort to provide transactional capability with your fork, but you’ll have to attract customers to use your fork for their ideas. In addition, from my understanding, you’ll need a solid development use case on why/how you’ll improve the existing code base leading to the fork. 
- - What is the state/payment channel in Ethereum?
  - An overly simplified explanation ‘State Channels’ is an approach to scaling the Ethereum blockchain by moving micro transactions off the Blockchain. From what I understand, no one has yet perfected this, but the foremost expert on this subject is a guy named Jeff Coleman. Here are a few posts that may help State Channels  an explanation What are State Channels? – Stephan Tual’s Blog 
- - Should I hold onto my $14,000 worth of Ethereum and Litecoin or sell them to recover some of my money?
  - Both eth and ltc markets are down because of the btc hard fork, at least until people start selling off their bitcoin. I assume you would be selling for a loss because of this, so my advice is to just hold until the air clears and the markets correct. 
- - When will the ethereum bubble pop and the ethereum’s price crash and burn to the ground?
  - Every smart investor is waiting bubble to pop! I claim it will not pop yet! Tomorrow at 818. Or not. Wait. Oh yes… sorry, we cannot know. We do not even know what a bubble is. The ground is not where crashed currencies burn by the way. I’ve looked.

  - Here is my view of the risks common to Bitcoin and Ethereum, most significant risks first In addition to these shared risks, the two currencies have some idiosyncratic risks.

  - Heres a quick list Even if BCC’s tech is better, there are still some major hurdles before theyll overcome BTCs force. 
- - Why do price movements in Bitcoin and Ethereum shadow each other?
  - Similar to the NASDAQ / Dow Jones index for the stock market. Investors can look at its overall health / long term trend or yearly increase from its chart without scrutinising over every small rise or drop. Both are the two major crypcurrencies currently on the market. Though all coins are overall correlated to some extent, I disagree that BTC/ETH shadow each other more than another major coin pair does. In fact, in terms of market cap dominance these two coins tend to move against one another 
- - When buying Ethereum on Coinbase, why is the buying price higher than the current price on dashboard?
  - The difference of $ 0.96 is what Coinbase gets to keep from each transaction. Because they are eating the difference. It is very frustrating that they charge you high fees to make a purchase but on top of that they eat the difference in the spread. You can go to GDAX which is their trading platform and see that the price is much lower and they still give you the higher quote on coinbase. The buying price = Price which sellers are willing to let go of their ETH for. 
- - How can you explain Ethereum?
  - Ethereum is a decentralized payment network, with its own cryptographic currency, that allows anonymous payments to be sent across the internet without the need for a bank or other third party. Why Ethereum is better then other currency ?? 1. Not only used for peer to peer transfer but you can also create your own ICO. 2. You can create your Cryptocurrecny and run efficiently. 3. Mining is the use of specific hardware that is used to confirm transactions on the blockchain.

  - All the advantages of Ethereum cryptocurrency do not mean that there are no risks involved in investing in cryptocurrencies. Just like anything else financially, they are not perfect and there are drawbacks of Bitcoin. Here we will discuss the disadvantages of Ethereum cryptocurrencies 
- - Why does Litecoin & Ethereum are falling though Bitcoin is increasing continuously?
  - The current rise is totally fueled by rejoicing the fact that CME and CBOE have announced their bitcoin futures in Dec. Japan is also following the same route and NASDAQ plans to do it in June 2018. There is huge institutional money that’s going to be pumped in bitcoin as aversed to any other currency and in anticipation, a lot of people are moving their investments from alt coins to bitcoin in the hope to ride on the crazy ride that bitcoin is making and is expected to make throughout december. 
- - Looking at the current trend, is it wise to invest in Ethereum?
  - It is and it isnt. No doubt Ethereum will continue to grow with Bitcoin, they both seem kinda relative at the moment. But but if you looking to get into crypto with lesser risk RIPPLE is the way to go. with it priced at $0.24 , it’s a no brainer and with the banks backing this blockchain we can expect it to reach the moon. 
- - What is the major innovation that ethereum has over bitcoin?
  - Smart contract capability, allowing several smaller blockchains and applications to be built upon the Ethereum network, is considered its major innovation. It’s an exciting time for this emerging technology, which will certainly shape several aspects of our society as a whole. If you are interested in learning more about cryptocurrencies and its history, please see my official Quora blog Cryptocurrencies and the New Era 
- - Is it a trend that the price of ethereum coin goes down?
  - Yes, this is the result of the rise of the cryptocurrency over the last six months. While I would love to say that the price is going to keep rising indefinitely, that’s simply not how markets operate. When you see large spikes in prices like what we’ve just witnessed, the price often drop considerably. Bitcoin did something similar to this back in 2013–2015, where the price rose to over a $1000, but then when through a 3 year crash where 70% of it’s value was lost. 
- - Is there any way to buy ethereum with PayPal?

- - Which are the main technical differences between Ethereum and Litecoin?
  - Which are the main technical differences between Ethereum and Litecoin? To demonstrate the differences, I’ll be using mobile phones as metaphor. When the first mobile phones were invented, they had a limited amount of features you could place calls and send text messages. More important, there was no way to add new features after the phone was manufactured and sold. 
- - Why is Ethereum switching to proof of stake consensus algorithm for their blockchain?
  - This is a very good answer Why Proof of Stake? Another problem Casper tries to solve is to disincentivize censorship. The PoW schema of Bitcoin is, more or less, a zero sum game. This means, if a miner loses a block it does not get included in the main chain/ it gets censored, all other miners benefit from their loss. PoS for Ethereum will not be a zero sum game but instead a coordination game, where the rewards for everyone are highest, if every participant can include their blocks. 
- - Is it safe to keep ethereum on Koinex India or is it advisable to move it to any wallet, if yes which?
  - Your wallet is simply a set of pairs of cryptographic keys, called public and private keys. In case of Koinex, Zebpay etc, your public AND private keys are held and managed by those companies. This means that they actually have full access to your cryptocurrency. If an employee in any of these companies were to go rogue, they could transfer all your money out of your account to theirs. 
- - How difficult is it to mine Ethereum?
  - If there are any words or phrases you don’t understand in the instructions, just search for them on Google to figure out the meaning. A better answer might be if you need to ask this question on Quora, it’s too difficult. Also, don’t forget that Ethereum will be switching from proofofwork to proofofstake soon. It might be too late to invest in mining equipment now. 
- - Is it appropriate to call Ethereum the AOL or Myspace of cryptocurrency?
  - Ethereum is more like TCP/IP than a single .com startup. It is a protocol. Frankly I don’t get the obsession everyone has to try and put blockchain projects into boxes like this. If someone were to say, yep Ethereum is MySpace, would you then bet against ETH since MySpace failed? 
- - Once Ethereum moves to proof-of-stake how will Ether be generated?
  - Theres a 100M ETH cap on the supply right now due to the difficulty bomb, but it will most likely be extended. To achieve 8% ROI on 10M ETH at stake thats 800k ETH issued per year or .8%, so ETH will most likely be more attractive as a store of value. Although the specifics have not been shared yet, Ethereum is also designed to actually be able to LOSE ethereum coins after PoS... Meaning instead of the supply constantly appreciating, it could depreciate... Driving value up even more. 
- - Whats your view on Lisk as the next Ethereum?
  - Its an interesting platform along with its own cryptocurrency and App SDK framework. Worth paying a close attention to. Its using a pretty rare DPoS and I guess needs more testing. Not sure if itll be able to beat Ethereum but who knows  It will most likely be used parallel. We had Windows, MacOS, Linux… then Android and IOS… Who won? Each of them has its own fans, and different employments. This isnt financial advice. 
- - Bitcoin or Ethereum, if governments have to get behind either and put the rest down, which would they choose?
  - Ethereum, because it’s better…for their purposes. It can only be used for certain purchases by certain people at certain times and only certain areas. That means somebody gets to decide What you purchase. no prohibited items, no competitors products. With whom you do business. only designated people, you’re locked into business with affiliats Where you purchase.only in your city/county/state, etc basically geofencing like they do with drones except you’re the drone. 
- - Why are their no ethereum mining computers?
  - Re mining I am not aware of any hardware specializing in Ether; people mostly use GPUs to crack Ethash originally Dagger, the Ethereum proof of work algorithm, as with many other cryptocurrencies.   Ethereum mining can be done with GPU, so there is no need for special hardware. The developers created a proof of work memory intensive algorithm to make it difficult to get implemented with ASICS. Ethereum around the end of this year will change to proof of stake, so no mining will be needed. 
- - Why should I invest in Ethereum compared to Bitcoin?
  - Ethereum is powerful. It is not just a currency, it is a world in itself. It helps for anyone with a technical background to create tokens, create smart contracts and even an organization in itself. Ethereum is the network, where ETH  Ether is the currency which is used in the network to create tokens and deploy contracts. 
- - If Ethereum drops, would that cause a drop in all other Ethereum-based/related assets?
  - No it isn’t. Ethereum tokens all have separate unique products that are not pegged on the price of Ethereum. Any platform that is based on another chain is a token. To be a coin you need your own unique chain. For example a chain/ coin called NxT also allows people to issue tokens. Same with a chain/coin called Omni, it was used to issue Tether. So yea, if Ethereum falls these tokens can go on another platform such as NEO or Cardano or EOS. 
- - Is there an app to buy and sell Ethereum like Zebpay for Bitcoin?
  - There isnt any platform in India which enables trading altcoins. Best possible solution is buy BTC from Zebpay or any other Bitcoin exchange, transfer it to some foreign exchange GDAX/Bitfinex etc and then convert it to Ethereum there. Once you have ETH in your exchange wallet, you can transfer it to a private wallet of your ownrecommended but not necessary. Dont treat any exchange wallet as bank account. In crypto its best to own the private keys for your wallets. Abhishek Not an app. 
- - Do you think Bitcoin will be overtaken by Ethereum?
  - It simplifies things if you look at both Bitcoin and Ethereum just like networks. The Blockchain infrastructure, which is basically a ledger of records that are secured through cryptography, is the basis of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin and Ethereum are values of two kinds of networks on Blockchain, with different approaches to how to use the Blockchain. 
- - What is peoples take on Bitshares and Ethereum?
  - some people disregard the idea completely, whereas the opportunists see it as quick cash these people ussually know nothing about investment and rise the cryptocurrency value higher by buying it for it’s current price. then there are proper investors who wait for it to crash to buy. 
- - Why did Ethereum rise from a $40 to a $400 difference during 2017?
  - A few reasons These factors created the right circumstances for Ethereum to explode in value. It grew as a platform and a currency. This bugs me, but… Oh how I detest their impacts on the market of GPU’s. How I hate the inflated prices of cards. The $50 increase on 1070’s. The 200% inflation on AMD cards. But they helped it grow. They supported the platform if only for profit, but they allowed it to grow. Still hate the damn miners. 
- - How can Ethereum impact the marijuana business?
  - It already has. It wasnt until I looked up todays news, and saw that Dennis Rodman had recently visited North Korea and given one of their official one of Donald Trumps books… while wearing a shirt that read “potcoin.com” While I still have much more of my own research to do on cryptocurrencies, the very fact that we now have Potcoin in circulation shows it is only a matter of time until cannabisoriented dapps become popular on Etherium not to be confused with its own ether. 
- - How do Ethereum smart contracts work?
  - Like many ideas in the blockchain industry, a general confusion shrouds so called smart contracts. A new technology made possible by public blockchains, smart contracts are difficult to understand because the term partly confuses the core interaction described. While a standard contract outlines the terms of a relationship usually one enforceable by law, a smart contract enforces a relationship with cryptographic code. 
- - Should I trade my Litecoin for Ethereum, Ripple, or simply leave it be?
  - Its always tough predicting the future so I won’t try but I will give you some thoughts. Since the founder sold all his Lite Coin there has been a lot written on the negative side of the coin. I would do a little research on Lite coin before deciding to hold. I have downgraded it in my estimation. 
- - How do I cash out mined Ethereum?
  - You firstly need to sign up with an exchange that will allow you to exchange your Ethereum for a FIAT based crypto token. So for example you are looking for ETH/USD, ETH/EUR, ETH/GBP pair.

- - What is the best practical use of Ethereum that you can think of?
  - Nowadays, methods used to buy and sell real estate are changing to keep pace the advances in technology.

And that’s why one common example you often hear about is that smart contracts applied to the real estate industry.

- - Is there any platform on the horizon that will challenge Ethereum?
  - Ethereum has some major hurdles it will need to overcome if it wants to keep it’s market share over the next few years.

In fact, the currencies became diffluent enough to deploy decent sizes of assets for professional traders. 
- - Is it profitable to build a solar powered Ethereum mining rig?
  - Probably not. I’ll just give you a basic rundown. For the sake of simplicity let’s say you are running 6 GPU’s and you need 1200 watts of power and off grid. You’ll need minimum 6 of these panels. We will call it 8 for good measure. Renogy 400 Watt 12 Volt Monocrystalline Solar Starter Kit With Wanderer That’s $4800 right there. Before batteries. I hope you have a place to put all these panels.

  - Yes… ETH is often used as a means to take part in ICOs. Bitcoin has more people buying and holding, increases in demand are a big driver of why the value continues to increase. However, ICO investing is starting to slow a little… and more will probably start to purchase ETH and hold. In fact, BTC is not very good for transactions… at least until new features are rolled out.

Hope that helps, best of luck  
- - Is Bitcoin or Ethereum more volatile?
  - It’s relative. If you hold $20 dollars in Ethereum and $20 dollars in Bitcoin, and both lose 20% of their value, you have lost 4 dollars of each. In my opinion Ethereum is more volatile overall, if only because it has a higher supply, it is newer, people can move Ethereum around a lot faster because of block times and lower fees, and also because Ethereum is an altcoin, making it more prone to pump and dump behavior, and less likely to be a long term store of value. 
- - Whats the fuzz about ethereum mining rigs?
  - The fuzz is that cryptocurrency and the blockchain are growing in popularity, and mining rigs are necessary to process the transactions on the chain. This means that mining is most likely going to continue to be a profitable venture over the coming years. If you do choose to mine, I definitely recommend purchasing Nvidia cards since they will be able to mine other coins beside Ether. I hope that was helpful. If you have any questions let me know!

- - What are some real world uses for smart contracts using Ethereum in 2018?
  - Before answering this question, we have to take a few steps back and get to the basics of blockchain and smart contracts, and why they have gained popularity in certain fields. Blockchain is a distributed ledger known for its immutability, which cannot be changed once it has been validated. Because of this, every participant in blockchain trusts the distributed ledger. Therefore, this kind of dictates which use cases and applications are the most suitable for blockchain, and, respectively, smart contracts. 
- - When Ethereum moves past $2,000.00 USD, is it likely we will see a sharp increase in the price of Ethereum Classic?
  - Actually it’s arguable. Good thing is  Classic has a great market cap and it’s bouncing back since last 7 days; which is a positive sign. However, if you compared to BTG Bitcoin price has hardly any effect on Bitcoin Gold. I know the hard fork isn’t successful that time. Theyre not related coins, so no. Also, this market is quite bubbly. I think the best thing to do is have a trading strategy that backtests well—just do fiat to crypto.

- - Is the mooted Ethereum proof-of-stake system a Ponzi scheme?
  - Ethereum Proof os Stake probably is not a Ponzi scheme. It is just the necessary evolution from Proof of work. In many ways it makes perfect sense The proof of work with thousands of GPUs running 24h per day is just not sustainable in the long run. My idea is that Ethereum team and Vitalik are not moving to POS to scam people, but for creating a global sustainable decentralised network However other minor cryptocurrencies might use the POS as a Ponzi scheme.

- - Why did Solidity replace all the other Ethereum programming languages?
  - I wouldn’t say Solidity replaced all the other Ethereum programming language. Solidity is one of the first programming language that was supported to be compiled into bytecode on the Ethereum Virtual Machine, and as a result it has grown in popularity and has more tooling than other languages. The next language to Solidity is Serpent which provides some neat Python like features, but solidity has grown in popularity and is very much adopted.

- - Could Bitcoin cash overtake the Ethereum market cap?
  - initially it could, as the implementation of bitcion supports its. But wait till ETHEREUM is implemented, [on bitcoins level] i doubt it has much of a chance. This will be MONSTER! I doubt it will be able to keep up. Longer term, Ethereum is going to be like BTC is. Remember BCC is a coin, but ETH is a revolutionary technology. Its like comparing the horse and cart to a car! Could it? Yes.. Will it? Probably not, unless bcc breaks 1000 USD and keeps climbing. 
- - What are the chances of cryptocurrencies like Ripple reaching $100?
  - RippleXRP is a digital asset developed by Ripple Labs for low cost cross border payments. Instead of managing float with US Dollars and other currencies, financial institutions will only have to keep Ripple with them. This makes XRP a very lucrative investment solution. Many marketers and blogs will promote Ripple is the next big thing. In my opinion, XRP is great but it will not rise to value of $100 because

Not many Indians find them safe and secure. Of course it is just my opinion and anything can happen. hello readers !!!! no one knows about future and no one can even predict it…..

- - Is it a good time to invest in Ethereum and Litecoin, or should I wait?
  - There are different scenarios that can be applied to both the cryptocurrencies. NOTE THIS IS NOT AN INVESTMENT ADVICE. ONLY INVEST WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.

After a lot of brainstorming and considering other available options I have come to the following two scenarios I won’t say conclusion, as that may influence your decision and certainly I am not running an investment advisory. So, here we go.

- - Where are Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. accepted in Hollywood?
  - 5625 Hollywood Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90028 Despite I’ve never been to Hollywood, this place looks attractive for me. I wish I could have something there right now. As for Ethereum, it’s difficult to find a place where you can pay with it. Even Bitcoin acceptance is not that common yet. 
- - Ethereum is now at $300 plus, but how much demand actually comes from smart contracts rather from speculators?
  - Very little unless you count ICO contracts. There are very few contracts which actually do something. Definitely nothing on scale of billions of dollars. That doesn’t mean it’s going to crash, though. Many people keep bitcoins as their savings, which is a very valid use case, and they can do same with ethers. In fact, Ethereum makes it simpler to create collectively owned accounts, for example. 
- - Are there any projects being built on Ethereum BlockChain that use Ether as token?
  - By default, most do. You have the occasional project like Auger or Gnosis that decide to create their own token. But then youll have projects like VariabL or the ENS that dont have their own token. They just build a smart app and go. However, even if a project decides to use a token, the base infrastructure is still the Ethereum Blockchain. A whole lot of them are in active development that you can track here  https//dapps.ethercasts.com 
- - Who decided the Ethereum hard fork?
  - The Ethereum Foundation, despite the mining communities wishes. After the DAO events, there was a discussion with the community on Hard vs Soft Forking.

- - How can Ethereum help businesses move money more easily?
  - Cryptocurrencies offer a new way of banking. The wallet that you use for storing your cryptocurrency coins can be used as a merchant/brokers type of account allowing you full customizable control over your businesses finances. This will make payments from your customers instantaneous, on the spot; even if the customer is purchasing from you halfway across the world. The purchases are also anonymous, if you offer services like massage, sell cannabis, or psychology for patients you may offer illegal practices with less risk. Ibogaine helps heroin addicts by completely removing their addiction withdrawals but is illegal in the United States. You could host sessions and charge for profit using a cryptocurrency by informing your customers and perhaps brokering the coin yourself. It creates a rabbit trail and is worth it for privacy sakes.

  - You find out the rate of each card and add it up then minus the wattage on the power base based on how much you are charged per kilowatt thats a baseline coat at most 8Mh/s, if that, running ethminer From a bit of internet research I think it would be around 13 MHs.

- - Is Ethereum Cash Pro a genuine coin?
  - Etherium Cash pro is a real coin. If you are planning to buy this coin I would say hold on because at the moment you may get the good return from Etherium itself. Currently ETH prices are at their lowest position and it is expected to rise very suddenly very sooner than later so if you want to make quick money ETH is good choice to go. No. The purpose of Ethereum is not to be a currency, it’s to be a platform. Any fork that tries to make it more of a currency is highly suspicious.

Also waves focus is on mass adoption, specifically target two markets  fiat transfers on blockchain and crowdfunding on blockchain.

Markets fluctuate for dumb reasons, but I believe in Ethereum, so it doesn’t matter to me. 
- - Is worth to buy and HODL Ethereum before it switch to PoS?
  - Yes, ETH is a young company though don’t ignore the fact that ETH is a very large Network and fungible use in the growing digital economy. This company will scale very large, fast and faster. A 
- - What would be the possible ways to put up Ethereum ERC 20 based custom coins up for sale to either actual Ethereum, Bitcoin, or Fiat?
  - That’s what every ICO coin is doing. The key point here is how are you going to justify the value of that ERC20 coin  what’s going to be behind it utility, an asset, etc.. 
- - Is there a BitcoinWisdom for Ethereum?
  - No, but there are alternatives like coincap 
- - Is Bitcoin and Ethereum trading halal or haram?
  - This is very tricky question and has a lot to do with your perspective of religious interpretations. But first let me ask what is your view on stock market investing is it halal or haram? My position is that you can invest in the stock market or in bitcoin market as you share in the profit when it comes and the loss when it comes as well. Which in my view is aligned with the Islamic requirements! But again this is my view and I dont claim to be an authority in this area. 
- - What skills are required to produce a robust Ethereum smart contract?
  - I would recommend two fundamental skills Although people think that developing a blockchain application is all about learning a new programming language in depth, this is only the skill required to keep you going once you have mastered the theory. 
- - How liquid is Ethereum right now?
  - Daily market cap at coinmarketcap says the last 24 hours’ volume was $150M That means you could easily get rid of $10M per day if needed at a good price. Poloniex is the largest exchange right now trading ETH, if they don’t use bots to enhance their numbers that is. Very close to bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has been stable and make overtake bitcoins liquidity if care isn’t taken. 
- - In present situations, which coin is best to buy, Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum or Litecoin?
  - I will put that this way by priority. Bitcoin by far, due to the fact that it is a legal currency in most countries unlike other crypto currency eg. Éthéré un of which is not considered a legal currency in most countries. Right now IOTA, Vertcoin and Monero 
- - Can Ethereum be tomorrow’s global virtual currency?
  - Ethereum breaks a crucial bullish trend line as hopes increase for an upward movement The future of any virtual crypto currency is dependent on turning the intangible into the tangible, thus it is the businesses and individuals that take cryptos in exchange of their goods and services  that will help determine the success of whatever cryptos are adopted... No, but can be tomorrows most popular Technology. 
- - Has Ethereum given up on proof of stake? Why?
  - Certainly not. But in a decentralized system like Ethereum, it takes time to find consensus in all protocol changes like POS. You can see Ethereum’s POS FAQ is still actively added to ethereum/wiki 
- - What is the ethereum hard fork and how it was possible?
  - Hard fork and chain split. 
- - How should an absolute beginner go about learning about Ethereum?
  - It’s actually quite easy. First, you need to understand what Bitcoin is. Ethereum and Bitcoin run on the same technology called blockchain. The difference between these two blockchains is that the Bitcoin’s one is limited due to its restrictive coding language. That’s why Bitcoin can’t really become anything else but a solid peertopeer payment platform. 
- - What is the next big cryptocurrency?
  - This is one of those questions nobody can answer you at this moment. Nobody knows which cryptocurrency could skyrocket next or in coin lingo “go to the moon” since there are so many altcoins at this moment. Predictions are very hard in any activity, and in an activity this volatile and risky, difficulty of predicting anything just ramps up a lot more. 
- - Should I mine ethereum?
  - If you already have one or more graphic cards capable of mining altcoins, it’s probably not a bad idea. Anything weaker than a GTX1050ti or RX560 is not going to be worth the effort, and it depends on what graphic card you have. Capable AMD cards from HD 7000 series and newer are best used for Ether Mining right now. The Fury and Vega cards are the exception, as they use High bandwidth vertically stacked memory HBM, which performs poorly with Ether mining. 
- - What will happen to my wallet and ether when there is an Ethereum hard fork?
  - Hard fork and chain split. 
- - Where do you see Ethereum and NEO in 2022? Not about a price, but instead articulate the kind of ecosystem that may grow around them.
  - It is all about mass adoption. Just think about old people who barely know what the internet is and dont even want to hear about it. They are happy the way they are, know that wont probably live much more, and overall enjoy a simple life taking care of their grandchildren. Besides that, many people dont embrace change so easily, even though they are Millenials or part of Generation Z. 
- - What are the most compelling arguments to buy ether Ethereum right about now?
  - I’ll keep this simple, feel free to comment if you want me to elaborate on a specific point. These are opinions, don’t invest without doing your own research. 
- - Why does Korea have such a high demand for Ethereum?
  - Very good article that should answer your question. This Is How South Koreans Are Trading The North Korea Crisis 
- - Is the price of Ethereum going up after Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed it?
  - Well, there are things like verbal interventions. They can affect markets. Ethereum price | index, chart and news | WorldCoinIndex The correction will retrace the wave 5 all the way down to its beginning. Putin’s nothing to do with it. Feel free to disagree. 
- - Should I sell my ethereum because it is so low or wait it out?
  - Ah, the goodold buyhigh and selllow a common mistake of new traders. Here’s what you should do take a look at the ETH graphs. To me, the bulls are keeping strong support at 6.6k BTC price. ETH price generally follows BTC movements, so pay attention. The 6.8  7k range is very risky to do trades which is where we are right now. Just hold. You can PM me at any time and I can tell you the risk of a potential trade and the general trend. 
- - Which is the best site for buying Litecoin, and Ethereum in Europe Germany?
  - IQ Option is an online trading platform that enables customers to trade a variety of financial instruments and assets such as Binary Options, Stocks, Forex and of course Cryptocurrencies. Top Sites to Buy Litecoin Top Sites to Buy Ethereum Founded in 2013 and operated by IQ Option Ltd, the site has quickly became one of fastest growing online trading platforms and claims to have over 20 million account holders from around the world. 
- - Will we see another dip/correction in Ethereum and Bitcoin prices considering that the 1st of August is still 14 days away?
  - Keep in mind that the challenges with ETH go way beyond just the August 1 issue with Bitcoin. Issues with Ether tokens include, but are not limited to Overuse of ICOs on the Ethereum network that caused a huge runup in the price of Ether. Continuing exponential growth in size of the Ethereum DAG, which is pushing recreational miners out of the market and consolidating mining pools. 
- - Is it a good time to buy Ethereum right now? The price is $448 at this moment.
  - Depends on your strategy  do you want to invest for the long run or a short term 6 month investment? If you are thinking 3 years then the time doesn’t matter, just ride the corrections but if it’s short term you might want to wait till it consolidates and I think it will consolidate around the $380  $400 mark. 
- - How does Ethereum Foundation make money?
  - The Ethereum Foundation’s mission is to promote and support Ethereum platform and base layer research, development and education to bring decentralized protocols and tools to the world that empower developers to produce next generation decentralized applications dapps, and together build a more globally accessible, more free and more trustworthy Internet. 
- - Which are the most useful apps built on top of Ethereum?
  - I personally think that the Ethereum Name Registrar is a pretty cool application. It’s an automated tool to purchase .eth names that are support by the major Ethereum wallet providers or soon will be. Best of all, it’s 100% autonomous. You can check it out here. 
- - What is the coolest Ethereum Dapp that you have used recently?
  - Original question ‘What is the coolest Ethereum Dapp that you have used recently?’ Decentralized applications or DApps are one of many amazing ideas that blockchains made possible. They are services completely decentralized, aka, not controlled by any authority. They operate with smart contracts which allow decentralization to happen. They are opensource and they award contributors. In this way, Bitcoin is, according to experienced users, considered a DApp. 
- - Will the Ethereum price boom again now that the August 1st 2017 Bitcoin fork has passed?
  - Yes. Ignore the naysayers, the entire market is going to have a massive bull run. I predict Ethereum to be at $1000 by year end. It will be some time but eventually yes. Bear in mind the large price rise back in April and May Were because Metropolis was supposed to be upgraded on the ethereum protocol. It has now been delayed until late 2017 early 2018. 
- - How has your experience been developing decentralized applications on Ethereum?
  - The smart contracts written in Solidity are not that complicated if you are familiar with object oriented languages such as Java; within contracts you will encounter familiar code. It does have some additional features of course, such as the payable keyword for methods that tries to indicate that a transaction will take place when the method is executed, such as the payment of wei a small amount of ether, based on the gas price and gas limit for the process, to the node for carrying out the computation. One immediate observation here is that the asynchronous calls you can make through JavaScript from the front end to call functions on the smart contract is that the processes take 15–30 seconds to complete, since they need to go through the Ethereum network. 
- - Is long term Bitcoin investment better than Ethereum forked or without forked investment?
  - To make the final choice you need to understand what is your purpose about investing. Both investments are good; most people take the argument that Ethereum is dead because the DAO incident and it’s not like that. Of course, they have several issues but they were solved and now you have more options of investment. Ethereum in long term is a good investment but as a currency, remember ETH doesn’t work like that, it just takes the shape of it. 
- - What are the differences​ between Ethereum and cryptocurrency?
  - The Ethereum Blockchain is considered decentralized in the sense that the transactions aren’t validated by a trusted third party; rather, it is verified by the collective nodes of the network that validate if the inputs before the event balance out to the outputs following it. Once a transaction is verified, it is added as a block to a ledger that memorializes all events as a chain of blocks hence “blockchain”. 
- - Is there a reason why Ethereum and Litecoin is down, and will they come up at all?
  - There are three primary reasons why the price of Ether and Litecoin are going down, as well as most other cryptos. Unfortunately for altcoins like Ether and Litecoin, their price largely goes handinhand with Bitcoin and, as we all know, Bitcoin is the household crypto name so it’s all some people tend to focus on. Therefore when Bitcoin suffers, so do almost all other coins unless they have a market driver specific to their platform. 
- - Why are people obsessed with Bitcoin and Ethereum when clearly the next generation that has superior technology is moving up the capitalization ranks to challenge and replace them, i.e. RaiBlocks and Cardano?
  - It is not clear that those other coins are superior or can achieve any of those things the founders claim. That is just a hype. The simple fact is, in order to prove that your software can handle scale. You need scale. Bitcoin and Etherium has been around for years, and year after year they have survived and improved. Consistently they handle several hundred thousands of transactions per day. 
- - Which is a better investment over the next month Ethereum, Litecoin, or Golem? Why?
  - Over the next month I would buy Litecoin. Ethers is having a major correction and Golem is a little bit stuck, also due to the slow development of its architecture. However, looking at a long term investment, I would distribute my finance in this way The reasons are Be alerted in real time of >major markets swings in real time >upcoming organized Pump and Dumps >important informations regarding cryptocurrencies ETH will surely suffer from ICOs liquidating their ether. 
- - Between Ethereum and Ripple, which is going to give maximum returns in the next 6 months?
  - All the major cryptocurrency are already trading very high that most people find it difficult to invest. Below is the top 5 trading cryptocurrency according to market capital. If you compare there past week growth rate, Ripple has grown tremendously out comparing etherum or any other cryptocurrency. So my choice will be definitely Ripple as it is cheap and looks more promising than any other cryptocurrency. 
- - How can Ethereum be used to store the ownership of properties?
  - Unfortunately, this is an area that is still under development. In theory, you would store assets on the blockchain by giving physical goods their own private key or device that can be used to validate it’s authenticity. Someone can then check if that key or device is able to sign the correct signature. 
- - Is it possible to create a cryptocurrency without Ethereum?
  - Disclaimer I work with Stellar and wrote the Stellar blog post. 
- - How long will the Ethereum mining frenzy last? How will the prices of the GPUs be affected when it’s over?
  - Considering constant power cost GPU’s that might have grossed about $5–6 per day are now only about $1.6 per day. So it looks good for gamers as the price of GPU’s should tumble down in few weeks to normal levels with various miners selling their cards on Ebay to cut their losses. I would stay away from those cards as mining on these cards means they are constantly being run at 99–100%, and pretty much have their life expectancy drastically shortened. 
- - Are there any events coming up that could raise the price of Ethereum?
  - You may want to research of fork to proof of stake. If that happens and the community believes its a good call, it is likely to bump up the price. Proof of stake involves less energy compared to proof of work. So it should be a positive development. My personal comments. Not any investment advice. Yes. B2B Business to Business transactional functionality. Yes, two major events 1 Ethereum is launching an enterprise solution, 2 Also Future versions of Visual Studio might include Ethereum ! 
- - Is there a need for all the various platforms such as Ethereum, Cardano, Lisk, Waves, and Neo? Will some of them eventually fail? Which are the best?
  - Some blockchain platforms will succeed beyond what we can imagine and others will fail and become worthless. Picking winners requires that you examine the team, technology, marketing, and, to be frank, that you have a large dose of pure luck. I think it’s far too early to try to predict which one will be “the best.” 
- - What is the best iPhone offline wallet that keeps both Bitcoin and Ethereum safe?
  - I would prefer going with hardware wallets like Ledger Nano S for cold storage purpose. Apart from security, there are pretty handy to carry. Making offline wallets on laptop or personal computers sometimes gives portability issues which is removed by the Hardware wallets. 
- - When should I buy Bitcoin and Ethereum?
  - Current price of bitcoin is around 3250$, just wait it will fall more . Traders are predicting that it will reach 3000$. China’s contribution was second after USA when it comes to Bitcoin. That’s why its falling drastically. Now wait till you see 1 week of steadiness in Bitcoin’s price. First week of November can also see more downfall. After that you can think of buying Bitcoin. Rest you have to understand that this industry is very volatile and any changes can happen anytime 
- - What should the Ethereum Foundations strategy be to make sure that Ethereum fulfills its potential as the worlds blockchain for distributed apps?
  - The strategy the foundation should follow As for the community 
- - Does Zebpay accept Ethereum?
  - I think they only accept bitcoin as far as I am concerned. Nope. 
- - Is Ethereum traceable?
  - Ethereum like Bitcoin is pseudonymous. What I mean by that is that people are identified by an address — rather than their names on the Ethereum platform. Hope that helps. Ethereum is currently traceable but they’re working on implementing a feature from Zcash called ZkSNARKs. ZkSNARKs Under the Hood – Vitalik Buterin – Medium Transactions in cryptocurrencies are traceable. 
- - Does the July 2017 Ethereum hack change its long-term outlook?
  - My opinion would be no. Not in the long term. Firstly, because the hackers only got away with $30m which sounds like a lot of money but in the world of crypto we were a lot lucky it wasnt a lot more! Thankfully a group of White Hat hackers moves most of the funds before they could be stolen. Additionally, the hack was not a direct hack of the Ethereum platform. The vulnerability was within the Parity Wallet so not effecting the integrity of Ethereum itself. 
- - What is the code that runs the Ethereum blockchain? What if the code is hacked?
  - There are many implementations of Ethereum. If the code is hacked… the consequences will obviously depend on the exact nature of the hack, how fast it is detected, and what actions are taken after that. A worse version of the above could involve this kind of hack happening without being detected so quickly, and coins being spent or exchanged, so that destroying them would screw over a bunch of merchant and exchanges instead of the hacker. 
- - Where can I buy options on Ethereum?
  - Check out VariabL. Its a blockchain derivatives market launched by StabL, one of companies from one of the original founders of Ethereum, Joesph Lubin. They are the closest Ive seen to launch, so follow them on their progress. As of April 2017, there are no major exchanges in the US offering ethereum options. You will be able to trade vanilla option on Ether and other tokens at Blockchain Board of Derivatives. Best wishes to all! 
- - Why does Ethereum lag behind Bitcoin, given the many more, newly founded companies that will use ETH as their reference currency and stimulate demand for ETH?
  - Bitcoin has the advantage of not being a scam, with a massive premine benefiting the developers, which is what happened with Ethereum. Bitcoin is also a decentralised peer to peer method of exchanging value, while Ethereum is a platform to build ICOs. As well as this, Ethereum is on very shaky legal grounds, because it essentially constitutes a security in the eyes of the U.S. federal law, and will probably be subjected to some regulatory problems going forward. 
- - How do you mine Zcash and Ethereum or other crypto at the same time?
  - Mining of various cryptocurrencies on the same platform may lead to difficulty. One can only mine one currency at a time with one machine. The concept of minng various cryptocurrencies is growing on the large pay scale along with the enhancement in the field of crypto world. 
- - Why is my Ethereum wallet not syncing?
  - Original question ‘Why is my Ethereum wallet not syncing?’ The fact that cryptocurrencies are growing in popularity and that users want to keep their funds in a safe place means having to handle a lot of specific bugs or issues like wallet syncing. Wallets are an especially important part of the process because users’ funds are being stored there. 
- - How much money did you lose due to the recent ethereum crash?
  - None. Zero. Nada. Zilch. The ones who suffered losses in ETH’s flash crash were the ones who didn’t trust in the potential of the Ethereum platform. They placed STOPLOSS orders to mitigate their losses. When you instruct GDAX to sell your ETH if it goes below a certain price because you think it might drop much further, it is a STOPLOSS order 
- - Why is Ethereum classic not rising?
  - Because the larger part of the Ethereum network has moved on to the new fork and left the old one, which is Ethereum Classic, behind. The only reason people stuck with Ethereum Classic was because it retained the integrity of the concept of cryptocurrencies as stated by the opposers of the fork. But after the fork happened, only a smaller set of people decided to stick with the earlier version, and hence Ethereum Classic became second to Ethereum. The latter is now rising with more and more widespread adoption while the former doesn’t have the amount of confidence that the latter now has. 
- - How labor intensive is mining Ethereum?
  - My experience is it is a pain in the %$#%. You get it all setup following fairly simple directions. After a bit of fiddling you see you the miner is reporting success and you are finding shares, with a 0 or very low rejection rate. Then you check the mining pool. Nothing, notta zip. But you check the FAQ’s and they say wait a few hours. So you check back later. Nothing yet… 
- - Why does Coinbase take too long to transfer bitcoins and Ethereum to a wallet?
  - Coinbase Global , LLC are criminals in multiple domains. You can find them on Linkedin. Where they had actually constructed a FRAUDULENT Profile! Incredibly audacious!! This fictitious, Profile could NOT have been accomplished without the utilization of proprietary personal and US Government entities! This information and data been reported to the authorities as STOLEN! Thank you for requesting this answer from me President Francis J. Underwood! I hope I can be of service here. 
- - What is the best between Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum casino?
  - mBit Casino At this moment in time, the mBitCasino is without a doubt, one of the most popular casinos present on the bitcoinbased gambling market. This is quite understandable considering the fact that it offers the latest, and some of the most advances bitcoin casino games, alongside with an innovative gaming platform that can be used by people from all around the world with ease. mBit Casino Bonuses 
- - Is it better to mine Ethereum with a new rig or to just buy ether with the rig money?
  - The main risk you would have is of a possible sudden crash of cryptocurrencies in the next 3 moths, which could wipe out your investment. BTW, the cards will still have value for gamers as your rig will be worth 70–80% of the original price even then. For instance, people who bought bunch of RX 470s months back, are now selling them for 50% or more than the original price, because the new generation RX 5x0 cards are more power hungry. 
- - Will Ethereum be diluted as more institutions buy in to it?
  - It depends on the actions of the Ethereum Foundation. If nothing changes, Ethereum will be produced at a steady decreasing rate and more users will join the network, making my Ethereum more valuable. If the price gets too high, I can see the Ethereum Foundation potentially increasing the supply of ETH to the network, which could eventually lead to a slightly inflationary currency. But that will likely not happen for quite some time. 
- - Is it possible to create a sport betting contract in Ethereum using Solidity language? How?
  - This is doable, but most importantly you will need to communicate the outcome of the game to the smart contract. Remember that smart contracts cannot interface with e.g. APIs outside of the blockchain; you need someone to send a transaction containing the outcome to the contract. 
- - Where should I invest 3000 INR BTC, Ethereum or Ripple?
  - First, before investing you should be clear about the properties behind the three cryptocurrencies that you have mentioned. Each cryptocurrency is designed to be better than another by trying to solve the problems associated with the former. Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple are three different things. Coming back to the point, Ethereum differs from Bitcoin in 7 main ways 
- - The Ethereum value is going down, should I sell my Ethereum which I bought with 660€, or should I wait hoping that it will rise again, and get even more value than the price I bought it at, and are there any hopes?
  - I would recommend you HODL. This is how the market tests you. This is not investment advice, just my opinion.  This is not investment advice. Just my opinion. How much does the amount of money you “invested” mean to you? Do you need it just to get by? 
- - How can I buy Ethereum from UAE?
  - Not just buy.. But even trade.. Bit oasis… Ive done it and its great.. Extent customer response as well 
- - If China is kicking out Bitcoin and Ethereum, what is its plan in dealing with cryptocurrencies?
  - The power of any cryptocurrency, and bitcoin in particular, does not reside in the decision of one or more governments. The value of all cryptocurrencies is subject to enormous speculation lately and, of course, any news or reaction from any government has a knockon effect on them. Nevertheless, I see government reactions to BTC, ETH, and other cryptocurrencies as a positive sign. 
- - How can I trade Ethereum on Mac?
  - Trading is not tied to the type of machine you have. Every trading platform can be access via a web browser, whether you have Mac, Linux or Windows. Take a look at Coinbase, GDAX, Kraken, Bittrex or Poloniex. You trade using your web browser. If safari doesnt work, feel free to use firefox. Click on Ethereum currency Then click on “Market” tab in the middle of the page Then you see list of exchanges, and its daily trade volume.Now, the hard part is select the best exchange that suits your needs.

- - I am considering building a mining rig for Ethereum. Do you think Bitcoin is going to crash and Ethereums value will rise?
  - Bitcoin might crash at any point but so could a lot of markets or any market rather. It regularly flashcrashes and recovers, so it’s risky, but it’s been around a while. Ethereum is newer and a different kind of investment. It is not really focused on being a currency or store of value. The value of Ether is in the potential of projects currently in development on the Ethereum blockchain, which has many big tech names involved, and the fact that the Ethereum platform/blockchain is used for ICO’s. So far no killer app or app has emerged and the Ethereum blockchain has been plagued by problems and isn’t even live. The developers are all paid in Ether so they all want it to be a success. The potential of blockchain technology is oft lauded and Ethereum is leading the charge in harnessing the potential of that technology. But there are a lot of new blockchains coming and the Ethereum Blockchain has been beset by issues. Maybe a new blockchain will emerge soon to replace Ethereum’s as the goto place for decentralized app development OR maybe an industrydisrupting app will pop from Ethereum and the price turns into Google stock. Right now, like Bitcoin, it’s speculation, but unlike BC the supply of Ether is not finite, it’s not about to be traded on the CME or NASDAQ and if a hit doesn’t emerge soon people may lose interest. Oh, also, the Ethereum Blockchain is open source, so they expect banks and other entities to share everything they develop with each other. Some might call this optimistic, others quixotic. 
- - How do Ethereum developers compare with Bitcoin developers in the job market?
  - Learn How to Build a Crowd Sale ICO App in Ethereum Blockchain from the industry experts. In this course they will show you a step by step process of creating a Crowd sale application. At the end of this course you will be able to launch your own ICO application in Ethereum and also extend it as per your need. 
- - While sending my Ethereum to another wallet, Ive used an Ethereum fog address instead of the Ethereum address. Now theyve disappeared into nowhere. Is there a way to recover my Ethereum?
  - technically it should be irrecoverable … but still contact the support staff as mentioned by someone below…. check this forum for more help Ethereum • r/ethereum To whichever exchange’s fog address you must have sent the Ethereum, kindly contact support/customer care of that exchange. The funds might not be recovered however the exchange might compensate with cryptos if you are luckier. 
- - Is there any website in India to trade Ethereum?
  - Not yet . Our team is working on it to store these coins offline in your phone . With this you can trade on international exchanges and store your coins safely in your phone . It is possible to use koinex and a few other popular services. There is an article about 3 easy ways to trade the Ether in India 3 Simple ways to Buy Ethereum in India Legally There is no direct way of buying Ethereum and those who are available are not reliable . https//m.youtube.com/watch?v=GYLwr1RH8BU No as of now 
- - Can ethereum go to zero?
  - Not in the short term. Ethereum is a platform like no other, at least for now. The demand on Ethereum will grow strong as more institutions, governments will be using it to manage their apps and smart contracts. In addition other ICOs use Ethereum to raise funds. So my understanding is Ethereum will continue to appreciate until a strong alternative sees the light. So far EOS is the biggest threat to Ethereum however it is still in the ICO phase and that will continue for another 9 months. 
- - How can we start Bitcoin or Ethereum mining? What are the technical challenges?
  - I recommend using Cloud Mining Services like Hashflare.io GenesisMining.com Unlike bitcoin, powerful and fast ethereum ASICs aren’t available right now. Installing the software After selecting some mining hardware, the next step is to install the mining software. First off, miners need to install a client to connect to the network. 
- - What is Ethereum Cashpro? Is it fake or a scam?
  - 10,000 free tokens just to sign up? What do you Think? Looking across the forums everyone is saying it’s a scam so there’s your answer. These idiots harm the reputation of cryptocurrencies to the extent that a lot of people who aren’t knowledgeable enough believe all cryptos are scams. They should have their sites closed down. 
- - What is the best idea to start ethereum investment business for ethereum investors?
  - Ethereum is upcoming one of the top most cryptocurrency followed by bitcoin. Ethereum price is always favorable to the investors and deriving business ideas like bitcoin. It is providing a good chance to step into the ethereum investment business. 
- - What do you predict the price of Ethereum will be in 2019, and why do you think this?
  - Noone knows what the value of Ethereum will be in 2019 because there are too many factors that could come into play. One of these issues would be further splits in the currency at one of the upcoming hard forks. To simplify the answer, I will assume that the op intended to ask “How much would 1 Ether, bought at today’s prices, be worth in 2019”. At time of writing this price is £150 per ETH. To sum up… 
- - Are people and businesses now switching their focus from Bitcoin to Ethereum?
  - Empirical Evidence shows that the adoption of Ethereum is gaining momentum Difficulty as an indicator for the amount of miners doubled in 2 months, from april to june Transactions double in 3 months steps January to March 10–20k, March to May 20–40k DOES BITCOIN LOSE MOMENTUM? Well after the big china price increase certainly not. But the transactions do not grow, as the blocks are full. The next 2 months will very likely tell if people migrate to Ethereum or not. 
- - Is ethereum undervalued? Will it rise?
  - I have already answered several time ate some variants of this question. I think Ethereum is the cryptocurrency with the most potential. Smart contracts are a true killer feature. Something that can change the world. Nobody has any idea of all the possible applications of a such disruptive technology. We have seen p2p loans, digital decentralized autonomous organization DAO, and ICOs, but it is only the beginning. 
- - How do I trade anonymously cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum?
  - First step is the most revealing one. You need to buy your BTCs or ETHs with the FIAT currency. If you are USA citizen your records and your trades at such places as Coinbase/GDAX/Kraken are traceable. 
- - What is the best exchange/wallet to buy Ethereum and Ripple in 2018 without buying Bitcoin?
  - There are many portals in India allowing to buy Ethereum and Ripple with INR. You need to do basic level registration and KYC with your bank account. Issues Currently you easily register but KYC is taking a long time, so it will take some time to actually start trading. 
- - In the foreseeable future, what is a likely price for BT, Ethereum or Lite Coin?
  - I am myself a small investor in cryptocurrencies namely Ether , Bitcoin and a couple of other cheaper ones… I have been reading on a daily basis on supposedly “experts “ in the field saying diametrically opposite thesis about the coins using fancy words , coining new words on a daily basis!!! An article says it is a bubble while the next one says it is the future and prices will eventually reach millions!! 
- - How many apps are currently running on ethereum?
  - One of my favorites? This is so cool… The grand vision of the Golem Project GNT is to create the first decentralized global market for computing power, combined with flexible tools for developers to distribute and monetize their software. The platform will allow users to buy and sell computing power... This essentially allows the sellers of the computing power to monetize their idle processing power therefore saving them a lot of money. 
- - Is this a good definition of ethereum?
  - Because this technology is so new, and so many people are newcomers to this field, no single definition is going to be sufficient. Curious newcomers are going to ask followup questions. If I called Ethereum ‘A blockchain’ or ‘a cryptocurrency’, the followup questions will focus on the nature of blockchain. This helps explain the technical mechanics Ethereum, but it doesn’t describe why it’s different than Bitcoin or any other blockchain. 
- - Is there an exchange for Ethereum blockchain tokens?
  - There are many exchanges for ERC20 tokens I use Bittrex and liqui. 
- - How can I mine 10 Ethereum per month?
  - You will need about 4100MH/s of mining power to mine 10Ethereum/month at today’s difficulty. Keep in mind that the difficulty continues to increase with time and your monthly earnings will go down. Lets take the GTX 1070 as an example and take a rough look at the major investments required. This GPU hashes at 30MH/s Your total investment will be approx. $95,000. Add to this electricity costs for running the rigs and cooling costs as well. 
- - Where can I buy Ethereum, IOTA, and NEO, all in one place?
  - Why Binance is good ? Trading instruments cryptocurrencies 
- - Is there any app built on the ethereum blockchain that makes money in 2018?
  - Before you go invest in an ICO or coin, I highly reccomend that you check out this blog post, some essential tips for picking your next winning investment! bitsme Crypto kitties is an Ethereum app which lets user buy virtual kitties for ether. Its a virtual game aimed at making money. 
- - Is a Ethereum smart contract really useful? If I ask someone to decorate my house, and sign a smart contract on Ethereum, and the guy is automatically paid when the stipulated date comes, what if he does a lousy job?
  - I am exploring overall blockchain space. So I will share my views on the same. Ethereum Smart Contracts can be really useful if applied in right situation. Wherever we have a clear black and white logic the smart contracts can be applicable. What we can learn here is flight delay and related payment can be defined in clear black and white terms and there can be no further disputes. At such places smart contracts can be really effective. 
- - What is the difference between the code stored on GitHub and the Ethereum blockchain? What is the purpose of storing code in both places instead of simply on the Ethereum blockchain?
  - This is a good question, and Im surprised no one has asked this yet. But to answer this, we need to know the scope of code on the Ethereum blockchain. It’s easy to think of the blockchain as some sort of cloud server that holds all code in its own separate space. This isnt really the case, however. 
- - How do I convert Bitcoin to Ethereum?
  - That is a good question, I will tell you can convert BTC to ETH on the best rates. CoinSwitch is a Cryptocurrency and AltCoin exchange aggregator. It is built on the most trusted exchanges in the world. They provide a seamless experience by integrating with reliable and secure exchanges and helping our customers get the best rates while ensuring their security. 
- - Out of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, Litecoin and Ripple, which crypto currency is most likely to replace cash?
  - Cash….. hmmm. Bitcoin no way. Fees are too high relative to small ‘cash’ purchases. Ethereum also has this issue  that will likely be fixed  Litecoin being far cheaper and faster has a good chance at this use case. And Ripple is closer to being like a ‘dollar’ than any of them. So as ‘cash’ I would venture Ripple. However there is one thing Monero has that none of the others do. It is truly untraceable, like real hard cash. In this use case Monero wins. 
- - Now that the price of Ethereum is over $40, is it profitable to start mining it?
  - In theory, it would become more profitable to mine ETH today than two weeks ago. However, there are a lot of political factors that play into this answer. The Ethereum Founder’s view of the ETH mining community can be describe as neutral to wary. They aren’t really interested in having a super profitable and powerful mining community. 
- - Hold Bitcoin and Ethereum, but buy Bitcoin Cash, Lingham recommends. Do you think it is a smart recommendation?
  - The question is basically asking “Is it a good idea to hold your Bitcoin and ETH holdings, and buy Bitcoin Cash?” 
- - What are bitcoin and Ethereum killers which dont use mining?
  - Nothing is going to “kill” BTC or ETH. 
- - Is Koinex.in a reliable source for buying Ethereum in India?
  - Yes, it is reliable. You can refer to my earlier answer for more details. Rishabh Agrawals answer to What are some reviews of Koinex, for buying and selling cryptocurrencies? Happy Investing! Rishabh 
- - How do I start developing on the Ethereum testnet?
  - Now you’re all set. Good luck! Learning Solidity is fairly straightforward if you have a decent OOP background. Best of luck! 
- - What is DigixDao and is it related to ethereum?
  - TL;DR DigixDao is doing what the gold standard did with the Dollar Once upon the time the Dollar note was a convertible bill that represented a certain amount of gold or silver in the Federal Reserve Bank. You literally where able to show up at the FED counter and convert your Dollar into gold. 
- - Do you think the dollar price of a bitcoin or ethereum will eventually increase to 6 figures?
  - For the vision of Bitcoin to be complete, its price will be above few hundred thousand dollars. You can not become a global currency, if the market value is not even some trillion dollars. Bitcoin is in the game to replace the Gold not US Dollars, not Chinese Yuan but the GOLD. 
- - Is it worth buying Ethereum Classic at $22?
  - Ethereum will be shifting to a hybrid protocol namely the Casper protocol which is a mix of Proof of StakePoS and Proof of WorkPoW, this is to make the transition smootly but eventually it will one day be entirely Pos based. This will make miners move from Ether to Ethereum Classic increasing its hashrate and userbase which will drive up the price so yes it’s worth buying ETC at $22. 
- - Why did Ethereum have a flash crash?
  - Someone placed a multimillion dollar value market sell order on the GDAX exchange. This had two main effects The lack of liquidity meant that some peoples market stop loss orders were executed at much lower levels than the stop activation level. I heard one horror story of someones $300 stop loss being filled at a price of $0.10. Not an asset class for the faint of heart. Hope that helps. 
- - Why is the value of Ethereum suddenly rising ?
  - Full Disclosure I dont make charts on my own but follow the ones who do it best. 
- - Should I invest in crypto Litecoin or Ethereum now or wait until August 1st?
  - This isnt financial advice, its for learning and entertainment only. Although no one can predict the future, many think that the crypto markets will be bullish for the month of August. If that is the case then now is the time. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you either way because I cant predict the future. But, I can say that if you wanted to get into cryptocurrencies now might be a decent time unless you believe the markets will go down on August 1st. I would wait until August 1st 
- - Is there any ethereum and bitcoin trading platform that does not charge any fee?
  - All fees mentioned above can affect the bottom line of your trading operation. All cryptocurrencies are blockchain networks. These networks need to be secured with cryptography calculations. There are people, who provide their resources, computing power, bandwidth and energy to keep the network going. To provide them, they take reward. This is the transaction fee, and it’s payed every time you send coins from address to address. Even if both addresses belong to you. 
- - Will Ethereum mining end soon? If so, then what can I farm with my RX480 instead of that?
  - Once Eth goes PoS, you’ll have miners moving to other coins and probably selling their cards, so you’ll see a shake up of earnings, but ultimately, there is plenty of crypocurrency that needs mining power. Also, you can mine to Nicehash, which automatically utilizes your GPU power toward whichever currency/need is out there. It’s generally as profitable as Ethereum mining and they’ll pay you out in whatever currency you want. For more info on all of this, check out my post… 
- - What dictates the price of Ethereum? Has it peaked?
  - As for the question ‘has Ethereum peaked’, I’ll offer a comparison. As of right now, the market cap for Ethereum is about $8 Billion. To compare, the estimated M1 money supply of USD is about ~$3 Trillion on any given month. The price of Ethereum could increase by another order of magnitude and still only be at 2% of the M1 money supply. So no, I don’t believe the price of Ethereum has peaked, so long as the Ethereum Foundation continues to innovate. 
- - Will Ethereum wait until 1 or 2 years to recover to $400?
  - No. I’m pretty sure that Ethereum will be trending above $400 again this year before Christmas. Obviously the fork at the Bitcoin camp isn’t helping anyone, but we won’t have to wait 1–2 years. That’s mostly due to the bullish trend that Ethereum is riding. In fact, I’m pretty certain that ETH will be around $1,000 this time next year. I’m a long term hodler myself and I expect things to pick up around September/October and then to the moon. 
- - How many developers are currently working on Ethereum?
  - Hard to know. But I read somewhere sorry, don’t have a reference that there are 30x as many developers working on Ethereum than any other crypto entity. That, however, may change as others Stellar, Qtum, Qash, Iota ? expand their efforts are become more well known. 
- - If Ethereum has no limit to the number of tokens that can be generated, unlike Bitcoin, why is there not more fear of hyperinflation?
  - Ethereum mining rewards fall within a fixed range that is predictably normalized over time. We know what the inflation numbers are now, and what they will be in the immediate future. Unlike the inflation numbers provided by governments, the inflation level of Ethereum cannot be manipulated and hidden. This level of transparency and predictability is of tremendous value. 
- - What is the cost difference between hosting a simple Dapp via Ethereum and a web app using VPS/AWS? Is the cost of Dapp proportional to the Ethereum price?
  - First question Dapps. Dapps are 90% standard web development technologies and tools, not too dissimilar from the site youre already on. The difference is that a Dapp will utilize smart contracts to utilize the blockchain. So the comparison doesnt make a whole ton of sense because smart contracts cant be hosted on AWS, theyre hosted on the blockchain. Let me know if you have any other questions. 
- - How is Ethereum connected to blockchain?
  - Like Bitcoin, Ethereum is a distributed public blockchain network. Although there are some significant technical differences between the two, the most important distinction to note is that Bitcoin and Ethereum differ substantially in purpose and capability. Bitcoin offers one particular application of blockchain technology, a peer to peer electronic cash system that enables online Bitcoin payments. 
- - Which has more investment upside over the next 3 years between bitcoin, Ethereum, and silver bullion?
  - In my opinion I believe Ethereum has the biggest upside. The reason being, its made for the tech era and tech companies. The ability to do contracts and distributed computing allows the tech giants of the world to use the technology and who knows what they can come up with down the road. Ethereum also has much faster transaction time compared to Bitcoin which gives it a huge advantage. 
- - What are the biggest business opportunities with Ethereum?
  - This tells more about the answer to your question. Join Coinomia Passive Bitcoin and Ethereum Mining Opportunity! 
- - If Ripple and Ethereum are cryptocurrencies, how is it that they have specific uses like smart contracts with Ethereum? How can a cryptocurrency relate to a smart contract?
  - I hope that was helpful. References Smart contracts hold and get resources. If a half portion of the deal isnt finished, resources backpedal to the next party. In that sense, the smart contract acts as escrow and legal counselor settling the question while acting as an outsider for holding. Whats finest is transactions are transparent. Both parties discover when anything identified with the code changes, and when difference emerges, contract facts make discussions easier. 
- - How does Vitalik Buterin maintain his right to upgrade Ethereum? Is Ethereum like a page on Wikipedia that everyone can modify?
  - Vitalik Buterin has no inherent rights to update Ethereum. It is a set of protocols being driven by software being created by a number of teams. Vitalik, as its well respected creator, is given the power to continue leading it because people are willing to follow. 
- - Can I buy electroneum on Cryptopia using Ethereum?
  - Nope, you can’t. 
- - What is “Ethereum mining”?
  - 1. Register the basic plan fitting your requirement easily. 2. Choose the best and effective plan accordingly as per requirement. 3. Receive and collect mined coins through wallet. The mining has the task of generating and collecting more money by collecting more Ethereum, than the money spent by the miner on power consumption bill in mining activity. Beginners get better returns by joining and participating in a mining pool. 
- - Will Ethereum be able to survive the June 2016 hack?
  - It will survive, but how far will it fall? This is primarily dependent upon how the ETH developers and community handle the situation. The DAO wasn’t really hacked since the ‘attacker’ complied with all of the terms and conditions set forth in the smartcontract code. 
- - Whats the best motherboard, memory, and power supply for an ethereum mining rig?
  - Mainly you’ll want a 1200W power supply, 6 slot PCI Motherboard, and ~4gb of ram. Mainly all that matters in the rig is the GPUs. For memory, you want to make sure that you have atlas 4GB. I personally use 8GB just to be safe, plus it doesn’t cost that much extra. It can be any brand, it just has to be compatible with your motherboard. Mining doesn’t really use too much ram. 
- - How can one sell Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple from a Ledger S nano?
  - You can’t sell these funds directly from the hardware wallet. The Nano is just a hardware application. In order to sell funds on the Ledger Nano S, you need to primary exchange fiattocryptocurrency that will allow you to sell ETH, BTC or XRP. Here is the easiest method I found to liquidating altcurrencies This works like a charm. 
- - Will Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple or some other cryptocurrency conquer the world and if so why?
  - I will use Ethereum to explain. Ethereum offers not only a currency, but it’s own programming platform for smart contracts. Even Microsoft is using Ethereum’s platform for it’s new blockchain platform Coco. Ethereum tokens like these two will drive both the tokens’ and Ethereum’s price up. I would suggest investing in Ethereum and in tokens like these as well. Ethereum is what made the whole crypto hype of 2017 and drove Bitcoin to record highs as well. 
- - Does Cardano solve everything that’s wrong with Ethereum?
  - Hi, Sorry to be so short or bold but Cardano doesn’t even a smart contract platform developed so they can’t solve anything. It would all be speculation and in cryptospace everything changes really fast. I featured Cardano in a YouTube video where I discuss many things like their roadmap, leaderboard, news and much more. Crypto Escapades Part 8  What is Cardano/ADA? Crypto Escapades Part 8  What is Cardano/ADA? — Steemit 
- - Due to a recent drop in prices, is Bitcoin or Ethereum a better investment?
  - Purely technically, Ethereum/fiat is the stronger market than BTC/fiat and has been for a few weeks at least. Recently during the first drop in prices all over the crupto space ETH didn’t even drop to the lower part of the bbands, unlike BTC and other big cryptos chart by John Bollinger 
- - I want to diversify my portfolio currently consisting of 100% Bitcoin. Based on my research the most promising Altcoins are Ethereum, Ripple, Dash and Monero. Which of these coins do you recommend the most/the least?
  - It would help if you would elaborate on what makes you like these alt coins. Here’s my take Ethereum  Fair start  sort of, decentralized  no, private/fungible  no. Ripple  Fair start  absolutely not, founders hold most of it, decentralized  no, private/fungible  no. Trying to be ECoin for the banks. 
- - Is Bitcoin or Ethereum worth investing in?
  - yes currently they are, One good thing about Ethereum Virtual Machine is , Thousand’s of ICO companies are using it so it’s not going anywhere any time soon , there are some issues with Bitcoin orignal client but sooner of later due to Lightning of network that too might get resolved . take note there will definately be one or another cryptocurrency as this technology is just in its initial day’s it has a long path to go. 
- - Which is the best platform in India to buy ethereum?
  - I have been using koinex exchange in India to buy ether. I have found it reliable and fast. Best part is that the rates are decided by buyers and sellers depending on demand and supply, and not dictated by someone. Registration requires KYC compliance. You can use this link for registration to get free Rs 50. https//koinex.in/?ref=67f17b Try koinex from the below link https//koinex.in/?ref=0639dc 
- - Why do ICOs need to be built on Ethereum or any other blockchain platform?
  - ICO on already available platform reduces your development cost considerably. You don’t have worry about logic to create your blockchain from scratch and most important the security part is by default handled. Blockchains on Ethereum or Waves platform allow the creation of cryptotokens with the help of smart contracts. These contracts are basically computer programes ,which runs independently on your blockchain. They are written in language like Solidity which is quite similar to Javascript. 
- - Where do Ethereum coins come from after mining a block?
  - Nowhere. They just get added to the newest block each time. New ETH are added as a transaction when a block is added to the ledger. Based on the Ethereum protocol, once a miner ‘finds’ the next block, they have the right to send their address a certain amount of Ethereum used to be 5 ETH, now it’s 3 ETH. Unlike all other ETH transactions, this mining reward does not have any unspent transaction amounts it needs to reference. It just appears in the blockchain and can be spent from there. 
- - Is Ethereum mining profitable cost vs yield?
  - If you google “mining calculator” you’ll be offered a bunch of sites that will do the calculation for you, such as Mining Calculator Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash and Monero It also depends enormously on the value of Ethereum of course, and as we’ve seen, that can lurch around violently from day to day. Which is why any kind of yes/no answer is liable to be outdated quickly, even knowing all the details I mentioned above. 
- - Why are Ethereum transactions crashing today 26th January 2018?
  - It is due to because of Big Breaking news came from Japan. Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck, one of the largest in the country, was the victim of a massive hack resulting in a loss of 523 mln NEM coins, worth approximately $534 mln. App aggregrate news from all authentic source and only publish after checking its authenticity. Crypto Crunch  CryptoCurrency News Trends Updates  Android Apps on Google Play 
- - Was Ethereum built off of the bitcoin source code or from scratch?
  - What can be considered reference implementation of Bitcoin bitcoind is written in C++, while the two most popular implementations of Ethereum are written in Golang geth and Rust parity. Bitcoin and Ethereum also work in quite different ways Bitcoin is based on transactions, while Ethereum is based on state transitions of a virtual machine. Fun fact Ethereum started as an ICO on Bitcoin. Yes, apparently people used to do ICOs on Bitcoin D 
- - Why are Bitcoin and Ethereum growing so fast?
  - Assume, meaning of “growing” in this question is with respect to Market capitalization. I see this as a reversed Pyramid, with It is the “Common speculative folks” that’s driving the Market cap of Bitcoin and Ethereum and hence its growing. See news articles about some countries looking to legalize Bitcoin as a payment alternative  
- - Is it good to buy Ethereum ETH now as it has broken 320$ resistance?
  - Yes, but who in the world can assure you about it? I would say keep investing in chunks rather than buying something in bulk and falling in to FOMO attitude  which is wrong. The whole Crypto space is like small baby trying to crawl. Remember the adaptation space is 99℅ and more. So keep it easy. Cheers It’s not a bad idea I don’t think. 
- - What is your take on NEO and gas? Will it succeed over Ethereum?
  - Since NEO is newer, it has improvements in almost all areas over ETH, including speed, security, compatibility, etc. Theres also the whole originated from Asia perk as well. No one really knows what the future will hold. 
- - At current prices, is it worth setting up a mining rig for BTC/Ethereum?
  - A lot of posts dive into the technical aspects, but that post breaks down the benefits and risks from an investment angle. The short answer for me is I’m still investing in mining, but as a portion of my overall crypto portfolio. I take a mixed with a portfolio that looks roughly like 
- - Im going to buy Golem, Siacoin, iOTA and Steem along with Ethereum for long term? Is it a good portfolio?
  - Ethereum have already demonstrated significant traction and is here to stay. As for apptokens, this model is still speculative. So far no token was able to demonstrate significant traction, so we don’t know if this model even works. STEEM has some users, but it seems growth is sluggish and so it might be overvalued — however, it still looks very favorable compared to other cryptocurrencies! So, nobody can tell for sure if apptokens are a good investment or not. 
- - Have you invested any money into Ethereum?
  - A2A “Invested” is too strong a word for “Ethereum”. The answer is “No”. All of these things seem like pumpanddumps to me. Up on the hype, down on the different hype. Like the people who used to get on the Yahoo stock message boards on Yahoo Finance, and have one sock puppet shouting doom and gloom to drive the price down so their shorts would be worth something. 
- - How long will Ethereum price continue to rapidly go up and why is it growing so rapidly right now March 2?
  - In short, it has spiked recently because of the big names who believe in it. This was covered heavily by the media, resulting in the bullish trend we are witnessing. IMO it’s a safe bet that Ether will continue it’s rise. Ethereum has a ton of potential with numerous practical implications. 
- - Could Ethereum reach much further than $1000?
  - It definitely will. It holds much more value than Bitcoin. Turing completeness makes it a lot more powerful and exciting. It has enabled the developers to literally reimagine the existing internet and rebuild it using Ethereum. As more and more apps will be developed on its platform, more Ether will be used. This will take the value of ETH much higher. 
- - What are some open-source Ethereum projects that one can contribute to?
  - duaraghav8/Solium Solium is an open sourced, code quality and security focused Static Analyser for Solidity. Basically we want contract developers to be 100% confidant of their code while deploying their contracts, because its a well known fact that once you deploy a piece of code on the ethereum blockchain aka Smart Contract, it is immutable and cannot be changed, even if you desperately want to push a bug fix. So we’re in the preventionisbetterthancure space  Hey Terrence, 
- - Is it possible to develop smart contracts without Ethereum?
  - Yes. Smart contracts as an abstract thing are not new; tying them to cryptocurrencies is the innovation. Ethereum is just the first mover in the cryptocurrency smart contract / dapp space, with the largest group of users/developers. There are a number of competitive networks NEO, for example and some promising upandcomers EOS, Cardano. Yes. It is just a block of code…use any Turing complete language. Hyperledger, Quorum,burst etc can execute smart contract… 
- - Should I buy Bitcoin or Ethereum now, or should I wait if they go down?
  - So if you put on $5000 it would be worth nearly double that. With ETHEREUM you are betting on the technology behind bitcoin {blockchain} will get bigger, it has not even started yet, so is this LATE….NO!!! Buy dips, and close eyes and forget about it, you will wake up in a few years with a smile on your face. Consider the following They will take a healthy dip soon. I would wait, but I have a feeling wirh BTC recent run up we might see 10K really soon. 
- - What is the value of Ethereum? What does it unlock?
  - “Zerotrust apps”. 
- - Where can I get first-hand news about ethereum?
  - Twitter is the best place for breaking news. https//www.ethnews.com/news 
- - What are Ethereum and Ripple’s USD potential value on years 18, 19, and 20?
  - Ripple XRP and Ethereum ETH are undoubtedly are ones of the most stable and popular altcoins. Ethereum focuses is adopting much faster as compared to Bitcoin cause of its advanced features. ICOs and smart contracts are being created everyday using Ethereum. Many of the people developing the literally thousands of projects on Ethereum are among the most knowledgeable persons in cryptocurrency world. 
- - Has anyone tried Ethereum mining?
  - I started building rigs at the end of May when the whole boom began. It’s been one of the most exciting projects I’ve worked on. It feels good to build something that produces passive income and contributes to the crypto industry simultaneously. I used Nvidia GPUs for my setup. They were a bit more expensive, but provided a high hash power for many other cryptocurrencies. If setup correctly, they can also a lot more power efficient than other GPUs. 
- - Why cant we have a block time of 17 sec with Bitcoin like we do with Ethereum?
  - I guess the real question is why would we have 17 sec blocks in BTC? We could have 17 sec block time in BTC as well if the community and the miners wanted to but it comes with a lot of disadvantages. 
- - Why is ethereum cryptocurrency so volatile, and where is the end of this volatility?
  - Any new company which is listed on a stock exchange generally has a ‘price discovery’ phase, whereby the market determines the price. The crypto markets are much more illiquid compared to the equity markets, so you end up with larger players being able to cause larger movements. So what’s happened recently? We saw the price of ETH plummet and this is what I believe is two things Smart money would have been buying in sub $300 and will be waiting for the market to return. Welcome to crypto. 
- - What will be the best price of ethereum in 2020?
  - Impossible to tell, and don’t believe anyone who says otherwise. If you are trying to decide whether it’s a good idea to invest in Ether, ask yourself the following If you see any gaps in your knowledge, go ahead and read a bit about Ethereum and the rest of the crypto market. Once you have a better understanding on the subject, ask yourself if you still believe that Ethereum will become more valuable in the future. If you do, get some  
- - Will Cardano reach a value thatis equivalent to that of Ethereum by December 2019?
  - Yes!! Come on now—there is literally no one who could tell you if a specific altcoin will increase in value by 1800% in the space of a little over two years. However, given that an increase roughly from $1 to $900 would give Cardano an effective market cap of $25 trillion if I’m counting right, let’s call it somewhat unlikely. 
- - What are the odds or probabilities of Ethereum Classic cryptocurrency making it to a $100 price tag? Also, are there any signs of a merger with Ethereum?
  - First things first ETC will never be merged with ETH, as a hard fork doesn’t have an elegant way of being reintegrated without another hard fork. Moreover, they split over ideological difference that have yet to be resolved. As far as a price, it’s possible that in the short term, the price could rise over $100. These are strange times we’re in. 
- - Since Ethereum is decentralized, when I start an Ethereum wallet and am downloading new node, from where does it download?
  - Every wallet contains a list of nodes with high availability which are called ‘bootstrap nodes’. These nodes store the IP address of every client that connected with them in a certain period of time. Your client will try to connect to those nodes, then each one of them will share periodically a list of IPs they are connected to, to enable your client to further expand your network. 
- - What is the best cryptocurrency to invest in as of Nov. 13, 2017, Ethereum, BTC, or BCH?
  - Ethereum has a future potent, BTC is ever increasing but geometrically, for now after the hardfork BCH is the most profitable crypto. But actually it is predictably less efficient as per now in terms of gain. The price has almost become stable for now and the investors are again moving into bitcoins. For something like what happened in the last week of this month, a breakthrough is needed. Then only the graph shall go exponentially in terms of profit. But for now you can invest in BCH for some considerable gain. 
- - What is likely to cause the next big price drop of Ethereum?
  - #1 Major Exchange Outage If you are long enough in the world of cryptocurrency, you might have heard about the incident of Mt.Gox hack. They were handling more than 70% of all the Bitcoin transactions worldwide. In February 2014, Mt. Gox suspended trading, closed its website and exchange service. Worst of all, they filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors. They allegedly lost $350 million in Bitcoin 7444,400 BTC. 
- - Can you explain the price surge of Ethereum in the last month?
  - Why it’s happening now, I can’t answer. You don’t know which snowflake caused the avalanche. What we can say though is that making it easier to purchase cryptocurrency combined with good press and understanding made an opening for something like this to happen. And we’re not even close to done yet. Personally I feel it’s down to the following three things, which I’ll explain, they’ve all had an effect this month hence Ether reaching all time highs in its value. 1. The Bitcoin ETF Rejection 
- - How can I open an Ethereum wallet easily?
  - See more here How to create MyEtherWallet The “MEW” is a web based interface that will allow you to create a wallet address and allow you to download a Keystore file. That keystore plus the additional password you set will give you access to your wallet any time. Make sure that you do not lose your keystore file as it is imperative to accessing your wallet. 
- - Does ethereum ether use SHA-256?
  - For hashing, Ethereum utilizes a calculation known as Keccak256. ... Keccak256 and SHA3 is still viewed as secure. As to proof ofwork and mining , Ethereum utilizes a bespoke calculation called Ethash, which is likewise more secure than SHA1. Began Secured Ethereum exchange with cryptobulls today. For more info visit www.cryptobulls.exchange It has different algo  Ethash. 
- - Is it too late to invest in bitcoin now? Should I invest in Litecoin or Ethereum instead?
  - I think you can still make money with bitcoins. But a good split would be 45% Bitcoin, 45% Ethereum and 10% Litecoin. It think that Ethereum is the future. The most disruptive technology. So it is a longterm investment. Ethereum is a revolution with a lots of crazy applications. It allows something called “smart contracts”. A smart contract is not a simple transaction, but an arbitrary piece of code. This allows the creation of an unlimited numbers of applications. 
- - What is the best price to buy Ethereum at?
  - This is like asking what is the best price to buy USD at. Its impossible to answer because the best price is based on demand principles at any given time point. Last year the answer to this question would be scores different to what it is this year. Last month, even. 
- - In Ethereum, if one party becomes bankrupt and is unable to pay their contracted amount, what happens? How do Ethereum contracts deal with that possibility? What if escrow is not a possibility, as it wouldn’t be in industries like insurance?
  - Etherium contracts can be written in several different ways to get different results, which is exactly why the system is so valuable. 
- - How low is Ethereum price expected to go?
  - The pullback follows a 5,000% rise in the price of Ethereum since the start of the year. eToro analyst Mati Greenspan told that the decline was likely just a correction after such a rapid rise. Concerns over the viability of companies using Ethereums network to raise money also contributed, he said. A little bit of technical analysis referring to this week Looking at the trend lines 
- - Who invested in Ethereum?
  - Ive invested in the Mthereum ICO. Not every ICO is a scam, and many cryptocurrency startups are legitimate. Ive already made a lot of money with other ICOs so Im happy to invest some of the profits into Mthereum token sale. They seem to be one of the only companies in the crypto lending niche that has a great customer support, project looks promising and nice team. Me too. Also, my portfolio includes BTC, LTC, ETC etc. and a couple of tokens like CAT, Dogecoin etc. 
- - Is it a good time to invest in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum in India?
  - When it comes to investing, social media platforms are not a good place to ask for advice. Investing in Bitcoins, Ethereum or any other cryptocurrency for that matter involves a lot of risk. Most people lose money because they don’t do any kind of research by themselves before investing. 
- - What decision has SEC ruled regarding Ethereum on May 7th?
  - The SEC did not formally make a decision. A discussion on Ethereum occurred in a working group with participants from the SEC and the CFTC, Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Let me explain. A working group is an informal meeting. Some people from the SEC and some people from the CFTC got together to discuss whether Ethereum qualified as a security. 
- - What is the best way to prepare for the Ethereum Hard fork on Jan 18th and subsequent distribution of ETZ if you have your ETH in Coinbase?
  - Simple  just move your ETH to a real wallet. You can’t know whether Coinbase will credit you ETZ or not, but if you have your own wallet, you don’t have to rely on other people’s decisions; you will own the private key yourself, so if you want to use it on the ETZ network after it splits, there will be nobody to stop you. 
- - As a software developer, is learning blockchain and ethereum worth my time if I am learning machine learning after work now?
  - That entirely depends on what you want to do. However, if you’re learning machine learning because you’re legitimately passionate about the technology, then continue learning that. Machine Learning is a large and expanding field that has it’s own host of new opportunities. Yes, blockchain is going to be big, but you can make the biggest impact with the tool you know the best. If that just happens to be ML, then don’t worry about cryptocurrency for now. It’ll be here when you’re ready. 
- - Is Ethereum an altcoin?
  - no, Ethereum stand’s on its own entity. Though, the definition of an altcoin can vary. Short answer no. The definition of an Altcoin is any cryptocurrency that is not Bitcoin. So, yes in that case Ethereum is an Altcoin. Yes anything that is not BTC is altcoin Altcoin stands for alternate Coin 
- - How will EOS be faster and have more scalability than Ethereum?
  - “How will EOS be faster and have more scalability than Ethereum?” The CEO of Block.One Lead developers of EOS, Brendan Blumer, claims that current existing platforms, do not allow the EOS blockchain to achieve massive scale adoption. However, the potential for EOS is huge. 
- - What is the significance of Ethereum?
  - p < .0001 — haha, no, just kidding. I assume you mean what makes Ethereum important as a blockchain/currency, especially now that China’s crypto ranking body for whatever THAT is worth has ranked it #1. There are a couple of things that distinguish Ethereum from other crypto chains 
- - Is Bitcoin or Ethereum going to be difficult to cash out if it reaches very high valuations?
  - Cryptocurrencies are bearer instruments valued only according to supply and demand. There is often some structural monetary inflation built in to incentivize early supporters of the network by giving them newly issued units of currency, but other than that the only way to obtain cryptocurrency is to trade something else for it. So if Bitcoin or Ethereum reach very high valuations, it means there is high demand for them, which makes it very easy to trade them for fiat currencies. The higher the valuations are, the more liquidity the system has, and it becomes correspondingly easier to trade out of the system without causing large price declines. 
- - What applications are already using the blockchain and Ethereum smart contracts such as CryptoKitties?
  - Here are a few Hi, 
- - What should I buy right now, Ethereum or Ripple?
  - Just follow this step by step visual guide You can buy almost all cryptocoins on binance with ETH and BTC. You will easily find many apps selling them but not other cryptocurrencies! These includes neo, iota, ada etc. I use Binance regularly. I love it. I am using it as my wallet. I love their customer support even though it is little slow. It also works best for residents of U.S.A also! If you have any questions, just ask me! 
- - Can you estimate how many people became millionaires from Bitcoin? Is it still possible with Ethereum?
  - I cant estimate how many people have became millionaires off bitcoin, but i personally know a close friend who has! Other than that, bitcoin will still go up in value. It hasnt reached a peak yet and continues to climn in the coming years. Ether and other altcoins will follow a similar projectory and i do believe ether will be around 4k in a few years, maybe more. 
- - Are there any other cryptocurrencies under $5 that I can invest in that is as easily accessible as bitcoin, ethereum and Litecoin?
  - I think, Genesis Vision GVT has a huge potential for upcoming six months. Its value is $3.5 now and there is just 4,436,644 coin as total supply. It means that if its marketcap reach $300.000.000, which is highly probable, one GVT will be $100. It’s possible because there are significant names behind this project. One of its adviser is Charlie Shrem who is Bitcoin Pioneer and Cofounder of the Bitcoin Foundation. I bought 40 GVT and I will wait 6 months to sell 40x100=$4000. It’s possible. 
- - What are good forecasting methods to use for Ethereum price forecasting?
  - It is incredibly difficult to predict where the price of Ethereum will go. This is not a matter of talent, or how “smart” you are — I mean, shit, you have possibly made a good deal of money investing in Ethereum. But now you have additional money to invest, and are unsure if now is the best time to buy. Even the best Ethereum traders/investors in the world are left dumbfounded about when to invest. 
- - Will a high ethereum price affect its ability to make smart contracts?
  - All else being equal, it should improve its ability to engineer and permeate smart contracts. Why? Network effects. The greater the confidence in Ethereum, the higher its price. The higher the price, the more attention it gets, the more people buy ether, use ethereum. 
- - Which is better, Poloniex or Bitfinex, for day traders Bitcoin and Ethereum?
  - Original question Which is better, Poloniex or Bitfinex, for day traders Bitcoin and Ethereum? It is rather difficult question to answer since both the Poloniex and Bitfinex have their own flaws and advantages. Nevertheless, important thing is what is better for a person in question, since it depends on personal characteristics. Poloniex 
- - Why has Ripple and Ethereum lost over 25% of their value over the last few days?
  - There are lot of factors at play, because of which the aforementioned coins have lost the gains they saw in a small span of time. First and foremost, Bitcoin. Whenever Bitcoin rallies, more often than not people sell their Alt Coins and hop on to the train named Bitcoin. 
- - Ethereum dropped to below $200 after reaching a peak at $425. Is this a great entry point to buy?
  - I think so. I bought some. But, I really don’t know. A couple thoughts But, I’m rambling. I could have better answered your question by just saying, “I don’t know, but I’m buying a bunch.” Good luck I will answer you question with a question! Did Warren Buffet Make his fortune by buying stocks when everyone got excited? Or when investors started panicking and running away?

- - Why is everyone so excited about Ethereum when infinite coins can be made available? This seems no different to fiat currency.
  - You cant be more wrong to say “Seems no different to fiat currency”. Like saying a Tesla is no different to a wagon because they both have wheels. Ethereum isnt specifically designed to be a store of value. Whether it is a good medium of exchange is up to debate which is not your question. 
- - Why is Ethereum increasing continuously while the rest of the cryptocurrencies fail to get upward momentum?
  - Smart Contract on ETH blockchain made everything possible. There are 487 Crypto Coins tokens which are using blockchain of other crypto currencies like Etheruem, Nxt, Omni, Waves etc. And almost 95% of the tokens are hosted on Etheruem Blockchain. 0x build decentralised exchange for ERC20 tokens on Etheruem Blockchains. Gems are building Mechanical Turk on ETH. Augur is making prediction market using ETH. Basic Attention Token is building peer to advertising platform on ETH. 
- - What are the pros and cons of creating token in Ethereum? Why do people use Ethereum instead of building a new coin?
  - Note I’m biased, I work for the Ethereum Foundation. The pros The cons Because Ethereum provides all of the relevant tools, including relevant smart contract features, and so on. There’s no reason for anyone to have to reinvent, or at least, rebuild, the “wheel” of creating their own token. That’s why Ethereum’s ERC20 is rapidly becoming the standard for altcoin creation. 
- - Where is Ethereum heading in 2018? Should I sell?
  - Short term down. And fast. Mid term say end of the year possible rebound, not guaranteed. Long term quite possibly very, very high but of course also not guaranteed. Just in case you’re new to trading which it appears that you are, you often want to do the opposite of what the price trend indicates. This is the core of the classic “buy low sell high” saying and professional traders swear by it. 
- - Is it worthwhile to buy Tezos or should I just hold onto my Ethereum?
  - This is very tricky question, 6 months ago ETH was just $8.4/coin and now its just about $300/coin at todays price! Trying to predict the price of altcoin is an effort in futility. Question is what does the Tezos ICO offer ? Is it just another coin or its a coin that is hoping to solve real life problems? Until you have clarity on what Tezos is about, Ill suggest you hold on to your ETH which seem to have found a suport point at about $285. 
- - Why does the Ethereum prices rise in the middle of the night during Asia time?
  - That’s because most timezones in US and some in Europe are in a prime business time while it’s night in Asia. Ethereum and all other crypto currencies being global in nature without any national boundaries are traded across the world and the volumes are quite high in the US and Europe day time. Imagine all those people trading Ethereum and all those ICOs opening up while you were sleeping  Because the Europeans and Americans are awake and trading cryptocurrency like mad lads. 
- - What differences and value propositions do Monero and Dash have as compared to Ethereum?
  - In 2014, Darkcoin was conceived later to be rebranded as DASH Digital Cash. Darkcoin was made a protection driven digital money that enables clients to preblend their coins by joining indistinguishable inputes from numerous senders into a solitary exchange that has serveral yields. 
- - What advantages will IOTA have after Ethereum implements Raiden Network?
  - These questions are asked a lot. Is this coin going to go the distance and is that coin going to supersede Bitcoin in value? They are impossible to answer much less advise on investment potential. To help put this in perspective let me time travel you back to 1991. I saw this.

- - In the Ethereum world, the proof of stake PoS will happen anytime soon, in September. Will it be the end of the Ethereum mining as we know it now? If so, what should be the next crypto leader to mine to remain in the money ITM?
  - Daily profitability fluctuations are always erratic. It is useless to try to speculate on which altcoin will be the most profitable to mine that far in the future. Even once it is much closer it still may not be possible to predict once an extremely disruptive event takes place. Yes once POS happens, Ethereum can no longer be mined. 
- - Will EtherZero affect the growth of Ethereum?
  - And what would they do with it? Who would mine Ether0? Which dapps will run on it? It is retarded, but these market lovely retarded shit lately, so who knows? I would never support or invest though, nor do I think it can affect Ethereum in any way. 
- - Which cryptocurrencies not including Bitcoin or Ethereum have thousands or millions of transactions per day?
  - Millions of transactions per day are not possible with the current blockchain infrastructure, as most blockchains have a hard cap of 7/transactions/second. So 600,000 is close to the absolute limit before additional changes will be needed. There are many more, in sure. bitcoin and ethereum 
- - Huobi, one of the largest Chinese exchanges, announced that Ethereum trading will go live on May 31, 2017. What is going to happen?
  - To put things in perspective The largest Chinese exchanges are BTCC Bitcoin China, OKcoin, and Huobi. In comparison, China makes up nearly 24% of the global BTC trading volume with nearly $183B traded in 24 hours and growing. This is second only to the US, coming in at ~31% of global BTC trading volume at ~$241B within 24 hours. That said, trading volumes are constantly in flux but the overall trend points to strong secular growth overtime. 
- - What is the “Ethereum project”?
  - It is a peer to peer cryptocurrency, much like Bitcoin or Litecoin or any other, with a public blockchain that is used to verify and store transactions. 
- - Will the Ethereum blockchain be utilised exponentially by business? Why or why not?
  - Yes, I believe that as the public blockchain grows, businesses will begin to understand what the real value for the technology is and find a way to make it work. This is not unlike how the internet grew. It took a long time for businesses to really figure out how to make the most of the technology. After some trial and error, transitions of power and bankruptcies, the business community as a whole started to ‘get it’. 
- - Why do investors invest in Ethereum ICO when they know they could mine Ethereum themselves?
  - Well, Ethereum ICO concluded in 2015 and people are now just buying it. First of all, people are buying Ethereum mostly for speculation, in other words for day trading. Second, Ethereum is bought because people exchange it to other coins. For example, they buy Ethereum so they could then buy EOS or anything else that has ETH/X pair. 
- - Do you think Ethereum will crash below $100?
  - What are the prices of Ethereun or Cryptocurrencies pegged to? If there’s a supply and a demand, then we could understand it better. At this point of time, prices of most cryptocurrencies are speculative and does not have any intrinsic value. Therefore it’s hard to guage how much would a cryptocurrency be. For a currency to ‘crash’ or drop there has to be a reason behind it. 
- - What is the reason for the ethereum price fall after the successful update?
  - A lot of money has flown into bitcoin, people want to have as much bitcoin as possible before the Bitcoin Gold fork on 25th since they get the same amount of that new coin  free money. As soon as the fork is done, I expect people to rush back into altcoins like ETH.

- - Should I sell some of my dogecoin and buy ethereum?
  - If you are looking to make a financial gain then yes. Dogecoin has a fun, exciting community. However the token has little use. Ethereum on the hand could be a massive disrupter over the next few years. Sell your dogecoin ? Not a good idea. Hold on to your dogecoin and rather buy more of it. If you want to own ethereum I will suggest you buy it with funds other than exchanging your dogecoin for ethereum. You may regret in the near future. 
- - How do I receive additional coins when Ethereum forks next month? I use Coinbase.
  - Hard fork and chain split. 
- - Why does Ethereum use its own programming language Solidity and not a popular one like Java, C# or JS?
  - This might change soon. And if you’re now wondering “why not just use the JVM”, it’s because EVM code is metered in a very specific way  certain instructions have certain monetary costs associated with them, and if you go with a custom VM you are free to say which instructions will exist and how much they will cost. While retroactively adding cost calculations to JVM bytecode, which was never made with that in mind, would probably not work well. 
- - People think that Ethereum will go up in the future, is it optimism or wishful thinking?
  - Question People think that Ethereum will go up in the future, is it optimism or wishful thinking? To answer your question in the simplest terms, it can be both optimism and wishful thinking. Then again, it could be neither. But your premise reflects wording that is commonly used when President Donald Trump asserts some absurdity as being true; “People think…” 
- - Is an Ethereum Wallet address case-sensitive?
  - Ethereum addresses are displayed in HEX, so they are not case sensitive. You could capitalize or lowercase any of the letters, and the address is still the same, since A and a are the same in HEX. However, a lot of wallets do a checksum to see if the address is valid, and the capitalization is used to make this check. When you send it though, this transaction will still go through and show up just fine. 
- - Will mining Ethereum destroy my graphics card if the temperature is at 65 C?
  - I think its fine. Ive been running an R9 390 continuously for weeks at around 75 C, with everything stable and good. I believe for Nvidia cards the max temperature programmed into the cards is around 85C, at that point the card will slow itself down to get back within reasonable temperatures. So 65C is well within that number. 65 C is generally fine. 73~75 is pushing it, and people will generally agree that you don’t want to run at 80 for very long at all. 
- - How do I invest in ethereum and how do I track its activity?
  - Open an account in many of the exchanges such as Buy/Sell Digital Currency  Coinbase Bitcoin Exchange, Trading BTC USD, BTC EUR  CEX.IO Buy, Sell and Margin Trade Bitcoin BTC and Ethereum ETH  Buy, Sell, and Trade Bitcoin Most of this exchanges provide their own charts however if you want to view it together with other exchanges / charts of FX i use free stock charts and quotes online 
- - Which are in your opinion the coolest tokens out there, except Bitcoin and Ethereum?
  - Here are some coins that have caught my attention Imagine a new chain that allows different chains to communicate with each other with more that just money transferring. For example how lightning network, let’s uou send Bitcoin to Litecoin network without sending a network transaction, once you’ve opened a channel, but this allows you to do it natively. This is going to be the future of Blockchains because currently different chains can’t communxiate with each other, AION changes that. 
- - Who are the best and most reliable writers about Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc?
  - Seems like I can offer my candidature  if you feel like my expertise and constant involvement in bockchain “evangelism” and studying of the subject also following the news can be of any help to you. I write about Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies and have done so before it got big. I already have a decent following on Quora, so feel free to A2A or follow me for more reliable information about cryptocurrency. Yes, shameless plug indeed. 
- - How profitable is Ethereum mining in India? For example, if I have a mining rig in Mumbai.
  - yes its profitable in mumbai too. it consumes 500units around 15% of montly gain 
- - What is the difference between a crypto token and blockchain technology Ethereum vs. Ether?
  - Blockchain technology provides you the infrastructure, APIs, SDKs to develop your Distributed applicationie DAPP. You can build many DAPPs on top of a Blockchain network. Crypto token is a digital currency which itself is a specific DAPP running on top of a Blockchain network. Hope this clarifies the concept. Think of Ethereum as a car which can be customized to do a variety of different tasks, such as go to the grocery store or take a road trip. Ether is the gas that goes in the car. 
- - What would be the most excellent way to buy Ethereum in India?
  - I work at ThroughBit. ThroughBit is an exchange for Buying and Selling Bitcoin and Ether in India. ThroughBit is not a peertopeer platform, meaning, users buy from and sell to ThroughBit. To facilitate 24X7 trade, we have developed INRFalcon. INRFalcon is a smart contract on Ethereum and 1 INRF is always equal to 1 INR. Bitcoin and Ether are global, 24X7 markets and the only way to transact on Indian exchanges is through Banks. 
- - Is the sudden drop in Bitcoin and Ethereum something I should be worried about?
  - Not at all. The value of Bitcoin, Ether the cryptocurrency for the Ethereum network are immensly susceptible to news, compared to traditional stock markets. I remember a time when hackers would DDoS the predominant exchanges of the time Mt Gox, Cryptsy because this would directly and indirectly depress bitcoin prices, enough to gain a great entry point. Today, the market is a bit more resilient than 2013, but it is still very sensitive to major news cycles affecting this space. 
- - What are some very simple but good use cases for Ethereum tokens?
  - The most interesting use case to me for Ethereum tokens is replacement of functions requiring a trusted third party today. Today, these functions are typically handled by some type of business entity. Meaning two things The ICO market is a good example of this. While today it is wild westish. You need to do your homework thoroughly or you are likely to lose your shirt. Imagine this.

Depending on the country selected from the dropdown list of countries where Remitano is available, the platform displays all the sellers and buyers from the respective location. The exchange rates of the cryptocurrencies is displayed in the local currency. 
- - How much power does the Ethereum development team have over Ethereum?
  - The developers of a project assign these crazy tokensale caps, more money than any startup would ever need. The Ethereum foundation members+ core developers use their own celeb status to actively promote these projects as advisors, for which they’re compensated well, luring in people who have no clue what they’re buying. Consensys promotes all of this since it’s the marketing branch of Ethereum. The more fools that buy in, the better. Ethereum is not decentralized. 
- - Why are US citizens not allowed to participate in Ethereum ICOs, such as Status.im and others? Why are we blocked?
  - However, the basic issue is that certain kinds of these token sales or ICOs, if you prefer that term look, from a legal perspective in the United States, like a traditional sale of equity. 
- - How scales ethereum in comparison to bitcoin in number of possible transactions?
  - About the same for both. There were days in August this year when ETH exceeded the number of BTC transactions. As far as I remember there were 400k transactions on eth chain vs 350k on BTC. So it is happening. 
- - Did Ethereum build off the Bitcoin blockchain or did it start from scratch?
  - There are two ways to interpret this question The first word of this whitepaper is ‘Bitcoin’, and goes on to praise the innovation that the Bitcoin blockchain brought to the world. Clearly, Bitcoin was the inspiration for Ethereum. To answer the second question no, Ethereum is not built off of the Bitcoin blockchain. Each blockchain has it’s own unique genesis block, it’s own currency and methodologies.

- - Is Ethereum Classic a rival to Bitcoin in terms of its uses as a store of value?
  - Bitcoin vs. Ethereum Some people buy Ethereum thinking theyre buying something like Bitcoin. They’re not really the same at all. Bitcoin is decentralized and has a cap on total units. Ethereum has no cap on units making it inflationary and a bad long term store of value. Additionally, Ripple/Ethereum is controlled by a small group that can and does edit the all important blockchain as illustrated by the DAO debacle of 2016. 
- - What’s the best hardware to buy for an 8 GPU Ethereum mining rig AMD?
  - Personally, I always recommend the GTX 1070. The hashrate of the GTX 1070 is 30mh/s which is pretty fast and it’s only 130 watts. Not only is it pretty fast and low power, but the GTX 1070 is also pretty reasonably priced. Don’t just listen to me though, get out there and look at different GPUs and compare the hash rates, power consumption, cost, etc. Make sure you are getting the best bang for your buck. 
- - How do I convince my grandma to invest in Ethereum?
  - Grandma, do you know who holds your money at the bank? You are smart, you know that money now a day it’s just numbers running inside Bank Software applications! Do you have any idea how those applications work? Do you know who has access to them, who can go there and simply erase those numbers and make your Bank account go to 0? By the way, remember all those Banks that went bankrupt? It could have happened the same thing to your Bank, it can still happen… 
- - How has Ethereum changed since the $64m DAO hack in 2016?
  - DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE Ethereum’s price at the time of the attack was around $20 and the stolen Ether amounted to just over 3.6m units which equals to $72m. However, as soon as the hack was exposed, the price plummeted to $10 over the next 24 hours. Therefore, some claim that only $36m worth of Ether was stolen. That’s just a different angle of looking at things, for those who might be confused why there are different amounts of stolen Ether quoted at various sources. 
- - Why ethereum is not depreciating as we are seing now with bitcoin and monero?
  - I assume you mean “Why is the fiat value of Ether not going down like X or Y”? The exchange rates for all cryptocurrencies fluctuate wildly, Ether the “gas” of Ethereum is no different. It goes up with hype and speculation and down with FUD. Sometimes in the opposite directions as well. Less than 2 weeks ago Dec 26, 2016, ETH was more than 30% below what it is today 
- - Do I need to do anything with my bitcoin and ethereum before the hard part?
  - I believe you meant the hard fork, haha. Maybe autocorrect. There’s nothing you HAVE to do but there is something you should do. Firstly, make sure to take your bitcoin off all major exchanges. Coinbase, Bittrex, Poloniex, Kraken, etc, and place it into a hardware wallet or cold storage wallet or paper wallet. 
- - Is there an equivalent to colored coins for Ethereum?
  - Ethereum supports customized tokens. This mean that you can create a token on the Ethereum blockchain. If you look at their site, you can see that the infrastructure for token creation is ready. Ethereumbased tokens are NATIVELY “colored”, “flavored”, and more. Bitcoin needs an additional infrastructure to address the issue of offblockchain value transport. Ethereum does not. 
- - Is there any Indian cryptocurency site available to buy Ethereum, IOTA or Ripple?
  - yes there are. Now you can buy Not only Bitcoin but also Ethereum, Litecoin, BCH, Ripple and OMG directly using INR in India. The other platform is Coindelta, which offers you OMG too. It is also a peer to peer platform but I found Koinex to be better service provider than coindelta. Yes. Bitcoin India. Bitcoin India is a platform that lets you invest in Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies like — To register and trade on the website, you would first need to complete KYC. 
- - Whats the most attractive ethereum mining pools?
  - One should go for one of the best and excellent Bitcoin mining pools which supports 1. 99.95% Uptime SLA 2. Robust Six Zone Layer Protection 3. Cuttingedge Hardware Technology 4. High Payout on Hashrate etc. Experience helps a person to gain his or her potential through different mining pools and contracts along with additional setup plans. Using excessive resources leads to deployement in the services as well as various setup plans and services. I personally use nanopool and ethermine. 
- - How low do you think Ethereum will go on 28-06-2017?
  - There will always be up and downs, its the market thats what it does. ~$200 was the lowest it went. I predicted $180$200, so not bad ; 
- - Will people move to Bitcoin, Ethereum or other AltCoins when the economy of a country crashes and fails?
  - I would also add an often overlooked detail you do not need a bank account to hold value in any crypto currency. Having a part of your networth not stored in a bank account is a way to protect yourself from the Government incompetence and abrupt abuse of its power. In the past, only rich people, politicians and their inner circles could afford to take their money to Switzerland and be shielded in times of disasters like those mentioned above.

These are, in order The very safest way is to use a paper wallet, it will be offline and as long as you don’t lose it completely safe.

  - The mining mechanism with fixed block rewards led to centralized network control in the hands of a few miners. This was because only those who invested early into specialized mining rigs controlled network decisions.

It provides the ability to create the tokens and smart contracts that enable all the unique features of Blockchain to be used in creative ways.

  - They have different versions and the prices are pretty good but I found this one to be successful in doing the right job. Hi there, 
- - Would you invest in Ethereum ETH?
  - Yes. I would invest in Ethereum for sure. I would buy it when its not down trending and I would build applications on it. I would have a long term view of Ethereum for sure. A pull back in price was always expected. Look at Bitcoin a few years ago it shot up from $40 to $1200 then settled around $400$600 for a couple of years. Though, now things are different, I think there are so many more buyers and potential buyers now, there is much more buoyancy in the price. No. 
- - Why is the Ethereum price highly dependent on the Bitcoin price?
  - Bitcoin’s market cap is huge. When bitcoin goes up, cryptocurrency index goes up and vice versa. Bitcoin is the de facto digital currency. The reason mentioned in the other answer is also true that FIATETH conversion is not offered by all exchanges, often times you have to spend BTC to trade ETH. Again, the reason is the huge volume of trade for bitcoin. When ETH will be a real challenge to BTC in terms of trade, probably we won’t have this problem anymore. 
- - Who is currently maintaining Ethereum network?
  - The network is decentralized and maintained by the miners. The software maintenance is made by the Ethereum development team. This is the wonderful thing about blockchain. No need for someone to maintain. Miners keep their rigs going to get their payment, and developers fix security issues, bugs and add new functionality. 
- - How do you buy Ethereum with INR and which exchanges are trustworthy in India?
  - Here’s a link to the article which will show you how to buy Ethereum with indian wallets. Because Ethereum is one of the best blockchain based platform in the world. And the fact that Ethereum has amazing feature and is revolutionizing the World of information technology is great. Helpful links I had already answered this question. 
- - Ethereum just increased by around $100 in 2 days. Will it continue to rise or is a correction possible?
  - Short term, it’s hard to tell where the price of any cryptocurrency is going to end up. Over the last couple of months the price has generally increased across all major cryptocurrencies. In a month, that trend could unexpectedly reverse and everything is going to decrease in price. 
- - Why is Ether valuable if its only one of many possible currencies available on Ethereum?
  - Why is Ether valuable if its only one of many possible currencies available on Ethereum? To run transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, you need to burn gas. The only currency to buy that gas is Ether. It’s technically not possible to buy gas using any of the tokens that run on the Ethereum blockchain. 
- - Will Enterprise Ethereum have an effect on the cryptocurrency ETH, and if so, how?
  - I believe Enterprise Ethereum will have some effect on the way the public Ethereum Blockchain is designed, but ultimately I see Enterprise clients using a separate implementation of the Ethereum codebase, leaving public Ethereum alone. 
- - If the stock market took a sharp turn for the worse, would alt-currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum grow in value?
  - Yesterday I met a man who is broker in stock market for more than 10 years. He knew about Bitcoins and has also invested a little in it. But he do not believe that Bitcoin is going to change the world. For him Bitcoin is just another ponzi scheme. If the market crashes, you do not immediately expect traditional investors to start investing in Bitcoin because still there is lack of information and some results to be seen. 
- - Do Bitcoin and Ethereum use the same Blockchain?
  - The short answer is that Ethereum is an application platform. Blockchain technology is useful for far more than keeping track of a currencys balances, and Ethereum lets developers build applications without having to build their own blockchain. These applications can interact with each other on the blockchain, so a library of useful functionality will gradually build up. Ethereum has shorter block times, which makes some applications more feasible. The Ethereum blockchain will transition from proofofwork to proofofstake, which will affect the security of the blockchain and the value of ether 
- - Why should a lawyer learn to code ethereum contracts?
  - I have looked up the subject. Here’s the description of ethereum I found 
- - How are the costs of utilizing ethereum blockchain linked to the value of ETH?
  - Edited  March 2018 ETH, the cryptocurrency, has a fluctuating price in dollars. But when we’re talking about using the actual Ethereum blockchain, they have a clever mechanism called “gas”, which has done a good job of balancing Ether price vs keeping the actual blockchain fees useable. The higher the Eth price, the less people are willing to spend it on transactions. Thus, the laws of supply and demand guide the miners to either raise or lower the gas price. Ethereum is also created through 
- - What is the best way to buy a large amount of Ethereum?
  - If you’re looking to buy a very large amount, you will get the best rate by purchasing over the counter OTC. This means that rather than dealing with a cryptocurrency exchange as a middle man, you buy directly from someone who is selling.

Depending on what your purpose there could be several steps specifically around hiding your identity. 
- - Which is the best exchange to buy Ethereum cryptocurrency in India?
  - Ethereum is one of the best way to profit by investing in the cryptocurrency market. Because Ethereum is the one who is breaking the records in the cryptocurrency world. The price of Ethereum is low, and it is slowly raising, thousands of people have profited by trading Ethereum. Ethereum is also said to overtake bitcoin in the coming years. And as Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain based platform, it will never come to an end like how bitcoin is going to end in the future. 
- - Is the fact that Ethereum is Turing complete a positive or negative in terms of its future?
  - Because the Ethereum VM is turing complete, I can technically implement logic in say Python and translate to solidity if I want. Turing completeness is important for Ethereum smart contracts because you have the ability to implement sophisticated logic. The biggest criticism I think comes from the attack surface being turingcomplete creates. 
- - Is it possible for EOS tokens to become worth hundreds of dollars like Ethereum?
  - EOS, though still in its ICO initial coin offering stage, which will run for over twelve months, is trading at $8.38. EOS aims to become the new blockchain operating system, faster and more scalable than Ethereum, allowing users to build decentralized applications more efficiently. Partners with Bancor Currently, Ethereum is the only cryptocurrency whose blockchain enables the Bancor Protocol. This provides EOS with a significant leg up, while dissolving one of Ethereums key moats. 
- - How can I cash my bitcoins out, and is it the same process for Litecoin and Ethereum too?
  - For example, Coinbase allows for purchasing of BTC, BCH, LTC and ETH through their exchange with USD. They also allow for the sale of these cryptocurrencies for USD. So liquidating your cryptocurrency is simply a process of sending your funds to Coinbase and selling for cash. 
- - How much longer will people be able to mine ethereum with 3 GB of VRAM?
  - I cant honestly answer that, but Im building a multidisciplinary machine and I installed an SSD. The SSD partitions vram as needed so its way faster and more fluid. Your VRAM should be equal to or almost equal to your actual ram memory to be fully functional. This isnt financial advice. I cant give you an exact timeframe but I believe you can convert the 3 GB to mine another altcoin. But, Im not 100% sure. 
- - Would it be a good idea to run Wikipedia on a public blockchain such as ethereum?
  - Blockchains would only offer utility if the wiki were distributed/federated. Maintaining a central database is simpler. Therefore, no, it would not be a good idea to run Wikipedia on a blockchain. 
- - Who gets to decide the price of gas that runs Ethereum smart-contracts?
  - The free market  The smart contract developer, may put a top limit on the gas. The miner puts a low limit of the gas. If there is a miner that accept, the selected gas, then the block will be mined. This is the free market model. 
- - Whats better as an ICO platform, Ardor or Ethereum?
  - Hi, It’s Great Question, Fortunately, ARDOR and EOS are envisaged to address the problems anticipated and finally observed with ethereum blockchain. https//goo.gl/47DCWL #icodevelopment #smartcontract #cryptocurrencytoken #icoclone Ethereum for sure Will bet my left nut that the answer is going to be Ethereum. Cutting the bullshit and calling dibs on ETH

- - How do I buy Ethereum in Hong Kong?
  - Gatecoin used to be my place to be, but they have some problems with their bank accounts. They even accept cash deposit at their office!!! No idea if it is any good but so far the fees are very high judging from their site. Nothing stops you from sending it to another exchange or personal wallet though. for a fee Gatecoin very easy, very reliable. 
- - What hash rate will I get if I subscribe to AWS P2.xlarge to mine Ethereum?
  - On the back of the envelope, a p2.xlarge would lose you money. The same applies even if you go with a reserved p2.16xl instance. No bueno. AWS instances will not make good ETH miners. Machine  p2.xlarge spot instance AMI  ami2cbf3e44 Miner  cppethereum Hash Rate  19 MH/s Result $0.19/hour For Ethereum on a P3.8x you’ll get ~350MHs, P3.16x you’ll get ~950MHs  Even with credit’s you’ll burn through then fast at ~$10–15/hr with the P3.16x as a Spot Instance. 
- - What will happen to Ethereum when Vitalik Buterin inevitably dies of health complications?
  - Everyone dies and Vitalik doesn’t have some kind of terminal disease that justifies your question. Before I say what would happen to Ethereum, I would say that the world will lose an intelligent, industrious and sensitive visionary. Ethereum will live on, it’s not based on a single individual. Satoshi Nakomoto didn’t die, but distanced themself from the scene, it didn’t harm bitcoins growth. Maybe you should think about your own line of thinking before asking such questions. 
- - Can we do Ethereum mining?
  - You can , however it has reached the difficulty level now. it may be expensive in terms of capital investment and also in terms keeping your self ahead in the race. but again if you are very good with all the capital nothing is impossible. you can also consider mining other relatively new digital currencies. for more info and updates on crypto . suscribe here 
- - What is the potential upside left, percentage wise in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple?
  - Theoretically it could go all the way up to the demand for cryptocurrency. Total supply is around 131 billion at some point last year for all cryptocurrencies. Depending on who you ask, the demand is in the trillions. If the coins rise to meet the demand, there could be considerable upswings left. 
- - Why is Ethereum not as good as Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency?
  - Really? Okay wait. #1.Ethereum is not a CRYPTOCURRENCY. Yes, you read that right. Not sure why that thought came to your mind. Did you decide based on their current market price? Ethereum is equally good as bitcoin, if not more. What Ethereum is trying to achieve, if they succeed in doing that, they will be the AWS/Google of everything. Would you still say Ethereum is not as good Bitcoin? 
- - Is anyone investing in the Bloom ICO decentralized credit scoring powered by Ethereum and IPFS?
  - We made a review of them recently, here it is Bloom What – Decentralized credit scoring platform When – Token sale from November 30th Investment – Somewhat Team 
- - Which is the best site one can invest his or her ethereum?
  - As for other Ethereum HYIPs out there. they are usually typical 15%/day “fast and furious” scams. Would not recommend those. The golden rule is to factor in these 3 key aspects of a HYIP before you invest in any scheme 
- - Which universal basic income projects run on the ethereum blockchain?
  - I’m not entirely sure if this is a shady scheme or a brilliant one. 
- - What returns can I expect in the next 5 years, if today I buy 100 Ethereum and 100 Ripple Coins?
  - There is no question about the useability of Ripple coin, lots of banks around the globe are willing to use XRP to cut the cost on their SWIFT payment charges and quicker transaction. Having said that XRP overall volume is $100 Billion coins, which is huge numbers by any means and also premined. With just $0.2/coin its market cap is 8+ Billion. 
- - How much is an Ethereum worth?
  - Yes, Ethereum is in second place after bitcoin with the second highest price per unit and second highest market total worth. Although like all other cryptos the value of Ethereum is also volatile it has remained over $500 for more than a year now. Ethereum at the moment in many crypto exchanges is $513 and since the crypto market is regaining its strength Ethereum is expected to be ready for a bull run with its worth. 
- - How does companies using Ethereum blockchain for smart contracts improve ETH value as a currency?
  - The concept of how Ethereum works for smart contract stems from the concept of ‘gas’ which guys at Ethereum have introduced. Gas is required for any computation with respect to smart contract which you build on Ethereum dapps decentralised applications platform. Let’s also look at it with an aim of deploying smart contracts and their complexity. As many number of computation steps do your contract require, that much amount of gas would would have to expend. 
- - What is the best way to make money from Ethereum platforms?
  - You can invest in nonscam ICOs on the special platforms. 
- - Will I be able to buy a new Ethereum hard fork in MyEtherWallet?
  - MyEtherWallet supports all tokens based on the Ethereum Blockhain whether its the native Ether or others such as Golem,EOS and Lisk. So as the new hard fork which will result in the new cryptocurrency being on the same blockchain, you will be able to store it in MyEtherWallet. 
- - What is best, buy ethereum mining equipment or purchase coins?
  - I dare say this depends on your timeframe. The mining equipment market is segmented on the basis of type, application and geography. The key market players which will dominate the market throughout the forecast period, 20162024 Vitalik, one of the founders of the Ethereum Blockchain, is pushing for the Proof of Stake transition to take places as early as July, meaning that by the end of year the network will likely be transitioned to the new consensus model. 
- - How is Bitcoin dependant on Ethereum?
  - Technically, bitcoin is not related to Ethereum, although both of them are blockchain based technologies. This means that the bitcoin network and the Ethereum network are two separate networks altogether. If we consider the price, often when bitcoin falls/rises Ethereum does the same too. But this is mainly due to the fact that many investors/traders have invested in both, bitcoin as well as ethereum and so their decisions to sell/buy are often proportional. 
- - Do alt coins built on Ethereum that rise in value make Ether more valuable too?
  - Yes, undeniably. You could see the main ETH network as a railroad  the more trains running on it, the more valuable the railroad becomes. And yet, think of what happens if too many trains try to use the same railroad  you will have traffic congestion and in the end people might want to choose another road. 
- - How much power required to mine ethereum?
  - It depends on the power and the hash rate of your miner. There are certain factors that you should make sure are right, which will eventually lead to better mining and will benefit you in the long run. If you want to know how much you can make mining Etherum, read the following article. Tips for better mining The mining algorithm and power used to mine have no correlation. 
- - Is there news currently breaking in Ethereum or is this move all technical?
  - No, there really isnt anything super big happening in the Ethereum community not enough to justify this much movement. Its just that ETH is easy enough to buy and awareness is starting to spread. I am a Professor of International Banking They are mostly two news  
- - Can Ethereum chase the first position in the crypto market?
  - No because #Bitcoin occupied that place, i.e let’s say there are millions of peoples are there in the world who knows about cryptocurrecies. But in that millions only kilo peoples knows how to invest in cryptocurrecies. So the leftoff peoples directly try to buy the #Bitcoin from there national currency then theyll buy #Ethereum. But Im not saying that #Ethereum will not increases the value but not at the rate of #Bitcoin and 2018 is very dangerous for every cryptocurrecies because there are so many countries who are going to regulate the transactions may be by #Banning or putting more tax on transactions. So that low investors moveout so that they can reduce the stealing of national currency from hackers, terrorists and other illegal peoples 
- - Is it worth investing in HashFlare Ethereum for 22k USD?
  - I have started mining recently, its been only 3 months. There are lot of factors associated which results in profitability. Current price, Mining Difficulty, Maintenance. I started with ZEC mining, looking at the current returns i think i can get my ROI in 8 months. Current price ZEC=400$

- - How do I trade in Ethereum?
  - I wouldn’t advice you to trade in ethereum, the price although volatile has the ability to surpass bitcoins in the near future this is mere speculation so why not buy to keep, download the etherwallet appi can vouch very well for this app as the maker has helped me times without number with issues i have create a wallet with the app, purchase bitcoins, convert them to ethereum via the app, this should take a minute or two and now you can store your ether for a year before resell. You should create a backup of your wallet on a flashdrive as this is an offline wallet, however it is the best i have used. 
- - What are the fees for transferring money on the Ethereum Network?
  - Fees for transfer on the Ethereum network are paid for using gas, which itself is bought using Ether. There is a standard fee of 21,000 gas for a simple value transfer buying ETH with fiat currency, buying ETH with BTC or other crypto, or sending ETH to another address. Gas is also used for executing smart contracts, with set gas values for each type of computation or data storage, but that goes beyond what you’re asking I believe. 
- - Are there any experienced Ethereum traders out there willing to give me their opinion on joining the ICO?
  - Since the advent of bitcoin, the overall excitement around decentralized technologies has grown exponentially. The imagined possibilities of what these new systems will do for humanity have only just begun being explored indepth. With a market capitalization of currently about ~$40 billion at the time of this writing, bitcoin remains the most valuable, and widely adopted cryptocurrency to date. 
- - Why is the price of Ethereum falling recently? Is it the beginning of cryptocurrency’s end or is it normal that cryptocurrencies prices go up and down?
  - I don’t think any of them are crashing, but they are certainly correcting from such a long period of sustained gains. 
- - Do you think Nxt compares with Ethereum?
  - At least as it stands, not really. Nxt is by no means an abandoned project, but many of the developers who worked on Nxt have moved onto other projects. There are other alternatives like the blockchains such as NEM that I think has potential to be a viable alternative to Ethereum, but that is yet to be seen. Based on market cap, valuation, and future prospect because of the broad applicability nothing I have seen really currently compares with Ethereum. 
- - Do you see potential for Ethereum cryptocurrency to rise above 100$ at the end of 2016?
  - It provides some more indepth analysis into Ethereum price. This guy predicts about $50 per Ether unit in 2016. Sure, its possible.  Its a cryptocurrency.  It could be $100 or it could be $.01 at the end of 2016.  Is it likely though?  Probably not.  Well need to see some real Dapps working on it first I think. 
- - How much will a small investment in Ethereum 0.02 ETH increase?
  - Well, it will be the same as an investment of 100 Ethers and no one can tell the future. After some time, you will still own 0.02 eth, but no one knows at what price, and I am no fortune teller. A 0.02 Eth investment is a really really low one so you definitely won’t get rich. But I believe in Ethereum long term, so its value will grow. 0.02 Eth is not a lot of money, so don’t really worry about it. Either keep it, or invest in some ICOs and leave it there long term. 
- - Why did the value of Ethereum suddenly drop?
  - But after proving the story wrong Ethereum’s price got stable again in the market. 
- - Are Ether Ethereum paper wallets safe from being backdoored or hacked?
  - They are reasonably safe, but you should do the following Also… There are no guarantees, but following these tips will make it much less likely that your private key will get out. Trading currencies or any other financial market involves substantial risk, and there is always the potential for loss. This is not advice of any kind, all content in this answer is for informational purposes only. 
- - Will I make a profit in 6 months and is it smart if I invest $300 each in all of these cryptocurrencies/coins DogeCoin, Monero, NEO, IOTA, Golem, Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin, and Etherparty?
  - Most likely. I have a significant amount of all of them in my core holdings, excluding Etherparty. Here’s what I think Dogecoin Dogecoin is ok. I don’t see it useful for anything longterm aside from tipping and micropayments. It will probably retain value due to Dogecoin ‘vanity’ though. I’m only holding it because it seems to follow explosive cycles. I charted it and found some correlations based on previous price actions. See it for yourself below. I’m watching for the next upward movements. Monero 
- - How would I go about building the most efficient Ethereum mining rig?
  - The most efficient way is to buy GPUs Video Cards that are going to last for a long time. A lot of people hopped on the AMD band wagon, and they are starting to find out that their card’s efficiency are going to diminish in the near future. You want to buy GPUs that will be able to efficiently mine all of the other cryptocurrencies Zcash, Feathercoin, Litecoin, etc… 
- - What is the likelyhood of Tezos replacing Bitcoin? Should I split my holdings, equally across Bitcoin, Ethereum, LiteCoin and Tezos?
  - But, to answer your question, Ethereum and Tezos do certain things better than Bitcoin. And Ethereum classic [ETC] has the temporary benefit of offering a higher payoff potential to miners. But the long term viability and likely market demand for Bitcoin is far more assured than other crypto coins, by simple virtue of achieving a massively distributed twosided network—in which a large number of users are nontech and using it for real transactions. It also has a commanding lead in weathering hack attempts and vetting the underlying math. 
- - When you buy Ethereum, what are you actually purchasing?
  - Well, your question is actually common. People either just think they know what they are doing or just are embarrassed to ask this question. Let’s clear some misconceptions Ethereum is a Blockchain Technology. Not a money. And Ethers or so called Ethereum Network Tokens, are the tokens or you can say money that it is needed if you want to use the Ethereum Network for any purpose only. So when you buy, you are buying Ethereum Network Token or Ethers. 
- - What makes Ethereum secure?
  - Born in Switzerland, the Ethereum project decentralized network and development platform was created thanks to crowdfunding to facilitate the creation of virtual currencies. It allows developers to design distributed applications dApps that run on a network of distributed computers to create markets and store pledges or move funds while maintaining data privacy. 
- - Is the intrinsic value of Ethereum necessarily coupled with the exchange rate of ether?
  - Currently, everything on the Ethereum network requires Ether to transfer because gas can only be paid in Ether. For example, Humaniq tokens require Ether to pay for the gas to be transferred from the Mist wallet to an exchange, such as Bittrex. This page breaks it down quite well. An Introduction to Ethereum and Smart Contracts a Programmable Blockchain Eventually, you will likely be able to transfer tokens on the Ethereum blockchain without using Ether. 
- - Where can I buy a legitimate ethereum coins?
  - If you plan on storing your Bitcoins long term here are the wallets I would recommend. Hope this helps. Useful Resources Good luck! Cheers, Jaxx Getting Started With Ethereum In 2017 
- - What is a very simple explanation of Ethereum?
  - Here is a simple, but long and detailed explanation  Bitcoin makes you spend your money without any intermediary; in my opinion its core is “no one can stop you to spend your own money”. Ethereum has a similar philosophy. But its focus is a program code, rather than money. Ethereum’s core is “Once you write a code on Ethereum, no one can stop your code execution”. In here, you can write your code with no restrictions and limits aka its language is Turing complete. 
- - What did Ethereum do right that other cryptocurrencies before it failed to do?
  - Ethereum blew up the market because initiated a revolution introducing smart contracts. In other words, it opened the possibility to create decentralised applications running on the Blockchain. Let´s illustrate, in a super easy way, the potential of decentralised applications Be alerted in real time of > major markets swings in real time > upcoming organized Pump and Dumps > important informations regarding cryptocurrencies

  - Anyway, If you hold any amount of ethereum now, ask yourself this question ’is it a good move to sell my ethereum now?’ Chose well! 
- - How do I mine Ethereum with a Samsung Note 8?
  - Let me first state that I am by no means an expert on crypto currency. From what I understand, Ethereum is geared towards graphics cards, as in the ones that go in big desktop computers. Based on this, it is unlikely that the graphics processor in the Note 8 would be efficient or powerful enough to make any sort of profit. In fact, I doubt that you would even be able to run a hashing program without your phone crashing, given how phones are much less powerful than desktop computers. 
- - Whats the best place to understand the basics of technology behind Ethereum for a techie?
  - hey. 
- - Why doesnt Poloniex make an app for cryptocurrency traders for bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.?
  - I can’t imagine they can be bothered with building an app, why would they? To generate more revenue? They clearly making a lot of money already. To facilitate for a mobile app they need to build a whole new infrastructure that is secure and stable as well. With the possibility to screw up their current trading system. I believe they just don’t have the bandwidth and attention. Haha, that is a good question. 
- - What is the difference between Mist and Ethereum Wallet?
  - You have to download Mist and entire blockchain, which can last forever. As a result, crypto owners can use it to generate keys for several Ethereum storage solutions, including an Ethereum paper wallet. The site has a static web interface that interact with blockchain so you can use it safely and dont need to download entire blockchain.

- - What do you think of AntShares ANS/NEO and the future it holds? Would it be a formidable competitor to Ethereum and reach its levels?
  - There’s a good chance that NEO will become Ethereum’s main competitor. That’s because of the main difference between these two networks NEO supports almost all programming languages via a compiler, whilst Ethereum requires all developers to know how to code in Solidity. It will naturally attract more programmers wanting to interact with NEO right from the start, rather than expecting them to learn a whole new language. This reason alone is a good base to steal a good chunk of Ethereum’s market. 
- - Is the Ethereum smart contract overrated?
  - If anything, smart contracts in general, and those developed using Ethereum’s technology, are underrated. They literally take many of the administrative functions currently done by humans and encode them in immutable, decentralized software. It’s worldchanging. When people go on and on about how big “Blockchain” is, what they’re really talking about are smart contracts. 
- - Is there any chance that Ethereum may become illegal?
  - Anything is possible. And to clarify, Ethereum is the platform and Ether is the token that enables processing on the Ethereum network. So not sure if you mean one or the other, or both. But, for what it’s worth, Ethereum has a range of support behind it, not least of which is the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. They have some recognizable members onboard, looking at ways to incorporate the Ethereum network into more mainstream operations. I’d be surprised if, given all that support, Ethereum would become illegal as a result. Even Bitcoin, which was used to power black market transactions, was never deemed illegal by a governing body. 
- - Which is the best suitable country to set up a Bitcoin or Ethereum farm?
  - If you are a crypto miner BTC, ETH or other Altcoin right now, there are basically 3 things to consider The shortlist of countries considered by mining companies right now are Russia is in play as well because of a 20GW surplus and abandoned heavy industry plant sites. China mined 60% of all bitcoins recenly. It dependes on electricity price, so where it’s cheper  the better. 
- - Can someone give a layman explanation of the difference between ethereum and bitcoin?
  - Bitcoin transaction consists from data and a script written in certain programming language. The transaction considered valid if the script evaluates into a valid output. Bitcoin script language is very limited and this is in order to avoid potential bugs, exploits and security issues. But, it severely limits what can be programmed to be a valid transaction. 
- - Where can I find ethereum mining hardware?
  - We have a few guides around that, have a look at How to choose a GPU to mine Ether with How to build an Ethereum mining rig In this guide you will find the detailed comparison of ethereum mining hardware. There are various sites where you can find ethereum miners ready available. If you are looking for good profit in mining then you should try the products of promax7 as their miners claim to have high hashing rate on the other hand it looks compact in size. 
- - What is your opinion regarding Ethereum Classic? Does it have any future?
  - It’s better than the new Ethereum. The Vitalik Insider Group’s ability and willingness to edit the Ethereum blockchain for their own benefit makes Ethereum Classic clearly the better choice from a consumer standpoint. When the Vitalik Insider Group forked Ethereum, leaving Ethereum Classic behind, they took with them the relentless corporate backing that was supporting the Vitalik Insider Group. 
- - How can I make more than 2k/m with Ethereum at home? What is the hardware requirement?
  - So the grand total would be ~$5K or so, assuming you assemble all this and make it work yourself. People are offering rigs on ebay now for 25–40% premium. All this sounds amazing as you could , in theory, return your investment in < 3 months. It is really a testament to how quickly and crazy things have gotten in the cryptocurrency world. 
- - Is it too late to invest in Ethereum now that it’s at $1,400? Has anyone ran a simulation on its potential?
  - I think it is a good time for buying some Ethereum. Ethereum is here for the long term. It is a revolution with a lots of crazy applications, and we are only at the beginning of it. Most of the current cryptocurrencies are running on the Ethereum blockchain Digital assets in Ethereum blockchain As a result, Ethereum handles more transactions than all digital currencies combined. Because many currencies are simple bitcoins applications. 
- - Why should we invest in Ripple instead of Ethereum or Bitcoin? Is Koinex worth trusting for crypto transactions?

- - What are the biggest changes for ethereum miners if it switches to Proof-of-Stake?
  - The biggest change is they will no longer be miners. Let me explain. In the white paper announcing Ethereum’s intent to implement Casper to migrate to Proof of Stake from Proof of Work. Ethereum refers to the parties facilitating transactions in the new system as foragers. Differentiating their activities from those of miners for proof of work currencies. Because proof of stake currencies reward the processing of transactions. Their is no mining per se to increase the supply of the currency. 
- - What are the difference between Ethereum and Counterparty?
  - Ethereum is a complete blockchain platform with the ability to store and execute programs on its blockchain. Counterparty is a project that runs on top of the bitcoin blockchain and allows users to do more than you can do with just the bitcoin blockchain for instance issue and trade tokens. 
- - What is the ethereum hard fork replay attack in layman terms?
  - In Ethereum chain when a hard fork occurred, two chains was formed. One where the hacked DAO coins was restored current ethereum and the other where no changes were done ethereum classic. The two chains that formed as a result of split were similar in all manners, except few transaction All DAO related transactions. This means a transaction done from an address which was not impacted by DAO attack was valid on both chains. 
- - What is the Ethereum Virtual Machine described in Computer Architecure terms?
  - The EVM is a machine with 20 byte addresses, with each address containing a counter, a balance value, contract code and persistent storage.

- - Can I turn Bitcoin into something else like Ethereum?
  - Yes, of course. I did that with one Bitcoin in summer. It was a bad choice I can tell you now. But it is not now in my opinion. I believe in Ethereum long term and compared to where it has been, Ethereum is underpriced. You can do that on any exchange, like Bitfinex, Bittrex, Kraken, GDAX and so on. You just move the Bitcoin to that exchange and sell for Ethereum. Then, if you’d like, you can transfer Ethereum back to a hard wallet or mobile wallet.

- - Is the price of Ripple going to compete with the price of Bitcoin or Ethereum in the near future?
  - XRP Ripple digital asset is not competing with Bitcoin or Ethereum at the moment. It is designed to be used by financial institutions for cross border payments. XRP will compete with Fiat currencies i.e. Dollars, Euros etc. Their aim is to have enough liquidity in market to incentivise financial institutions to use XRP for foreign exchange. In future, if it turn their eyes towards payments also that will be an another story. No way not in this Generation! 
- - What are cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Steem, Ethereum, and Litecoin?
  - I’ll focus on Bitcoin since it’s the cryptocurrency that started it all and everything else sort of derives from it. It’s not easy to compare Bitcoin to anything else, since it’s a very new concept, so you have to keep an open mind. The closest thing to Bitcoin is gold, because There are some key differences though. Other cryptocurrencies are similar in nature, but are designed to tackle different issues. 
- - How will SegWit2x & the USAF impact Bitcoin and Ethereum prices? When will they be launched?
  - Plans to implement the UASF User activated soft fork to adopt SegWit was originally planned for 1st August. However this date could be carried forward as early as end of July.

- - What will be the price of Ethereum by the end of 2018? Is it still worth mining?
  - The price of an ETH will reach the $2000 benchmark or $4,000 by the end of 2018, in my opinion. The price prediction is not a right way to answer, but I hope it will turn back to level at the beginning of 2018. However, it is the fastest growing platform which also provides ICO. I think the key issue here is ICO. There is no regulation or standard for Initial Coin Offerings. If there would, control or standard ETH might be effected. 
- - Is it possible to write an iterative script for the Ethereum platform that creates deadlock and crashes the Ethereum platform worldwide?
  - No, because the Ethereum Network includes the concept of Gas to hedge against this. Each transaction on the network compiles down to a set of machine instructions that each have a cost. When sending a transaction, there must be a gas limit attached, and enough ETH to pay for said Gas. There is also a max limit to Gas for any one transaction, and trying to run a Gas Intensive transaction on the network would cost a small fortune. In this way, Ethereum protects itself against these attacks. 
- - Does blockchain and Ethereum have any relationship to deep learning?
  - No. Though, initially smart contracts on Ethereum were called autonomous agents. There is no learning happening on blockchains, though there is a number of startups that are trying to apply ML/DNNs on blockchains. SingularityNEt is one of many attempts. 
- - Where can you view the actual smart contract code for an Ethereum ICO?
  - Assuming its an open source project, its likely posted on the companys website. Look for a link to Github or this logo on the website That will be the link to the source code if its available. If you gonna go ICO, then use OpenZeppelin 
- - Will OmiseGo move to the Stellar Lumens network, away from Ethereum?
  - No. OmiseGO won’t move to the Stellar Lumens’s network. That answer doesn’t fully explain it, so you should read this blog post from Omise on the Plasma Blockchain. Construction of a Plasma Chain 0x1 – OmiseGO Network

  - Global Blockchain Technology Market Competitive Players Global Blockchain Technology Market Overview 
- - Does Ethereums computational power massively increase as the Ethereum blockchain increases?
  - Nope. This is two separate things. Each block contains informations. About transaction, about contracts etc. News blocks are added regularly to form the blockchain. Therefore, naturally, the blockchain is getting bigger and bigger as we add new blocks i.e. data. The size of the blockchain always increase with the time passing, but the computational power depends on miners. Miners gives computational powers in exchange of some ETH. 
- - Is there an estimated price for ripple like bitcoin or ethereum in tens of years?
  - If we think Blockchainsbased economy is better than current one, then most likely we will see most of the money flowing to Blockchains in future. There can always be flaws in any system. Blockchains carry great promises but time will show. Problem is that we dont really know how much money is in the world. When we buy cryptocurrencies and log this money to Blockchains, we might just find out. My estimated price 
- - Why is Ethereum not more volatile?
  - How can you say it not more volatile. Many investing projects is taking Ethereum currency.

  - I think as a Data Scientist, you should care about Ethereum because of the growing need for people to understand their blockchain data. In the Ethereum Network, every transaction that has executed will be available on the blockchain forever. As more and more companies enter the industry, their businesses are going to rely on those transactions and how people are using them. They’ll start asking questions like 
- - What are the benefits of investing in Ethereum?
  - As more and more Dapps are developed, more Ether is going to get consumed to keep them running. 
- - What will happen to Ethereum as the market cap is decreasing but its price is increasing?
  - The market cap of ethereum is the price of ethereum times the total number of ethereum coins in existence. The only way this could be mathematically possible is if there were a drop in the number of ethereum coins. Since these coins cannot be destroyed only taken out of circulation through lost wallets, what you’re asking about is mathematically impossible. Well, if the price per coin is going up for ETH, then Ethers market cap will increase. 
- - Between Bitcoin and Ethereum, which is more computationally expensive to mine? What makes one more expensive to mine than the other?
  - Bitcoin and Ethereum use the same proof of work protocol, but let’s find out which is more expensive and why The proof of work protocol is like a lottery  It doesn’t matter that others have a greater computational power than you, it’s like they are having more tickets than you, therefore, more chances. Every 10 seconds a new block is deployed into the network Bitcoin has an average of 10 minutes 
- - What would happen to Ethereum if Vitalik left?
  - Going anonymous because my followers wouldn’t like more cryptocurrency answers! Okay if Vitalik left I’d pull my money outta their faster than the speed of light.

- - How long on average does an Ethereum transaction take?
  - Ethereum block times are about 15 seconds but many places require multiple confirmation before a transaction becomes “final”. The average time can also depend heavily on the network congestion. I actually made a crypto transactions 101 video that covers this topic and other FAQs. If you like it, I’d love a subscription and a like! It should take on average 15 seconds now but will be increasing exponentially as this is whats hardcoded in Ethereum. In August 2017 itll take 30 sec. 
- - How can I earn or mine Ethereum online for free?
  - I don’t know about Ethereum, but you can earn free Bit Coins Unless you have been living under a rock, you MUST have heard about bitcoins, the amazing cryptocurrency that has taken the world by storm with the kind of returns it has been delivering.

For e.g. Crypto price = 0.0001 
- - How can Ethereum handle all those dapps build on top of it?
  - Right now there aren’t that many dapps that are built on top of Ethereum. And even fewer that have any real number of users. So network load is not yet a problem. In the future when there are many more users, the Ethereum network will be upgraded to include many scalability features that are currently under discussion. By adding a trusted aggregators. 
- - Since the supply of Ethereum is not limited, I dont think that it is a good investment instrument. What do you think of it?
  - Yes, but youre thinking in terms of absolute supply and demand, rather than relative supply and demand. If Ethereum inflates at a rate of 1% a year, but demand is growing at 5% a year, that still means the demand outweighs supply and will raise the price. Unlike Bitcoin, whose value driver is based on its use as an investment vehicle, Ethereum is being used as a platform. So long as the platform grows, the value will grow. 
- - How will Ethereum address the Blockchain bloat issue? What are the possible solutions?
  - With POS Ethereum will bring Shard concept to counter the scalability issues. The idea of sharding is to split the space of possible accounts into fragments, for example, based on first digits of their numerical addresses. 
- - Is a wallet necessary for Ethereum and Bitcoin? Are the trading Exchange wallets not sufficient?
  - Yes, a wallet is very much necessary for both ether and bitcoin, and any other altcoin for that matter. Available for android iOS and web. ; example Ledger Nano S Hello, A wallet is a place where you store bitcoins. It is better to keep the trading exchange wallet separate from your savings wallet. It is similar to the difference between a current and savings account. Thats totally depends on how much control you want over your bitcoin or Ethereum. 
- - Is Ethereum more environment-friendly than Bitcoin?
  - Right now there is probably very little difference, insofar as they are both intended to be resource intensive. Ethereum is committed to transition to Proof Of Stake which would replace the CPU intensive Proof Of Work mining algorithms of Blockchain 1.0 implementations. 
- - Except Ethereum, what other cryptocurrency is backed by a lot of peer-reviewed research?
  - Hands down, that would be #18 on CoinMarketCap right now and still extremely undervalued, Cardano. Heres some of the research Code built from the ground, without forking anything. How many cryptocurrencies can even brag that they have original code? 15? 20? Cardano will be worth over 10 billion in market cap, in less than six months. 
- - Do you think that one day Ethereum will be more valuable than Bitcoin?
  - Based on their market cap, I dont think it unreasonable to see that change happen sometime in the next two years. Ethereum has a lot of momentum and a lot of innovation that, regardless of its value today, will keep the market moving forward. Even if Bitcoin does not collapse and continues to grow, I believe Ethereum will grow faster. Soon, were not going to be talking about Bitcoin and Altcoins, but blockchains and cryptocurrencies, of which Bitcoin is just one of the players. 
- - Is there a risk of losing money invested in Bitcoin and Ethereum? Does it mean a total loss?
  - Yes. There is always a risk associated of losing money invested anywhere. Risk involved in Mutual Funds is less and hence the reward is also nominal. Risk involved in shares or stock market is little more than mutual funds but reward is also more than mutual funds. Now let us talk about crypto, Risk involved in Crypto is way more than shares or stocks hence the return or reward is way more than stock market. Bitcoin alone gave 1100% return to those who invested early this year 2017. 
- - What will be the value of ethereum at the end of 2017?

  - Everything goes up will go down. Please read it carefully there some basic topics I have shared 
- - What do you think about Ethereum Classic? Is it worth investing? Why?
  - Something you should always look for in an investment is a compelling and durable reason why this coin is going to take off. Having researched the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap, I’m aware of many reasons to invest in many other coins, but ETC is not one of them. Also, if you don’t know, a hacker has about 1/3 the total supply of Eth Classic. That’s why Etherium broke off was to reverse the hacker’s theft. So, you also have a bad actor with a large portion of the coins. 
- - Bitcoin’s value is going down. Should I withdraw the money or should I buy Ethereum?
  - I am not talking about trading, but investing. I will write at length about trading. My partners 24option offer trading. More on that in other articles. Here I am talking about buy and hold for 10 years. Only use money you can afford to lose. A lot of experts who never saw the credit crunch coming, see the collapse of the cryptomarket coming. So bewarned. 20 years ago when I wrote my book trading online, I had to write it this simply. Deja vu! Which Crypto? 
- - When will Proof of Stake be live for Ethereum?
  - Pretty soon. ethereum/wiki When the founders decide to take that step. Until then no one knows for certain. My guess would be early 2019. 
- - How many nodes do the big blockhains such as Ethereum or Bitcoin have?
  - As of today Sadly there doesn’t seem to be a central source for this data apparently BitInfoCharts used to have this, but not anymore, so if you think some other chain might make the “big list”, let me know and I’ll try to look it up. 
- - Can you mine for Bitcoin and Ethereum on a single GPU rig at the same time?
  - Antminer S9 ~13.5TH/s @ .098W/GH 16nm ASIC Bitcoin Miner BTCBTCBTCBTC https//www.cryptocrane.info/pro... Jack answer is sufficient. There is no point in trying to mine both btc and eth simultaneously. Your productivity will be zero. Stay with eth if you want, since BTC is mined by large asic factories. Btw, ETH is more profitable anyways at this time. Mining Calculator Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash and Monero 
- - How will cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, change the world of finance?
  - Im quite certain eth wont, but Ill roll with it and assume you mean smart contracts in general. With a smart contract you get the security of the block chain on to a piece of code that is neither smart nor a contact… so what exactly are these things people are talking about? Lets talk about a simple “contact” a payment channel 
- - What examples can be given to show how bitcoin and Ethereum are not anonymous?
  - Take an arbitrary blockchain explorer like And just by knowing the address of an account, you can check out how much assets the owner has. It’s also completely transparent when who send how much to whom. Therefore, you’re able to construct a graph which shows the flow of money through the accounts. 
- - What is the status of Ethereum this July? Can it get back to $390?
  - Why Ethereum has a bigger future than Bitcoin ? That is likely over the long term. On May 17, 2017, Fred Wilson Union Square Ventures predicted that the Ethereum market capitalization would surpass Bitcoin’s market capitalization by the end of 2017. While, Olaf CarlsonWee Polychain Capital predicted this would happen by the end of 2018. 
- - Should more scientific research be done in the way Ethereum is developed?
  - I am not entirely sure this analogy works. If every part of a research problem can be broken down into a computational problem. Then that is what they are doing. But scientific research isn’t necessarily linear. I mean you can break down a distinct research project into a number of tasks and you’d have workers on it. Crowd assisted mathematical proofs. There is likely a lot of research into this area. 
- - Can I run a webserver in Ethereum?
  - No, Ethereum is run on a decentralized network of nodes. A web server is a single, centralized node. Even if you could build something like a web server n Ethereum, you wouldnt want to, as it defeats the purpose of a decentralized, trustless network. In a traditional web server, you have a web frontend and a server backend. With a dapp distributed app you have a web frontend and a smart contract backend, removing the trust of a central authority. 
- - Why is litecoin and Ethereum considered the front runners?
  - Litecoin was the first currency to clone bitcoin and was at some point considered the silver ti Bitcoin but it has lost much of its appeal as confirmed by its dwindling market capitalization. Ethereum is recent and now the second cryptocurrency per capitalization and daily volume of transactions. It is plagued by recent DOS attacks that led in a hard ford last 18 october 2016 and at the same period was victim to another attack. 
- - Is there any single wallet in India for Bitcoin and Ethereum?
  - Bitcoin India is the best exchange I can recommend as of now it has very low fees of 0.1%.The buy sell spread is very low, customer service is best.The INR withdrawal fee is just flat Rs 10. Join Bitcoin India today and get the referral bonus, click ## pros ## cons 1. KYC completion takes some time. I hope this helps you. 
- - What happens to the value of ETH if/when central banks build cryptocoins on Ethereum?
  - The value of ETH is based on both speculation people think the price will go up so they buy it and need I need ETH to invest in an ICO or to pay for a smart contract, so I buy it. If a large bank creates a need for ETH, the price will rise. If a large bank causes people to believe ETH will go up as a result of them using it, they will buy it, and cause the price to rise. It reinforces ETH’s role in the market. Can’t think of anything negative impact. 
- - At what price is it wise to start purchasing Ethereum, given that I will invest in it to hold onto for 5 years at least?
  - The price of ether has already increased over 1000% in 2017 so a significant pullback is certainly possible, however, when you are investing in an asset with such immense longterm potential, it’s better to just take a position rather than wait for an optimal entry point and possibly miss the boat. 
- - Is it a good time to buy Ripple and Ethereum? Will it rise more? Will Bitcoin go down further?
  - Ripple founders are playing “pump and dump”, they bought a lot of Ripple themselves which increased the price for a short term. I’m not sure about Ripple but Ethereum is a big yes. ETH is building crypto platform, ETH has more potential than any other crypto. Bitcoin will stay between $1300 and $16000 but it can go up up to $19K$20K in some months. You can start investing with Bitcoin and then progress with other currencies. 
- - What is the significance of smart contracts in Ethereum having no independent arbitrator or escape clause?
  - An analogy to cryptocurrency may help here. How does cryptocurrency differ from paper money? The primary feature of any currency is that you can’t counterfeit it. Otherwise the supply increases without bound as people print off $100 bills and the currency collapses. So no copying. With paper money, we expend a lot of effort to enforce this. We put complex images on the paper. Give it a unique serial number. Use special ink and deploy authenticity gadgets for tellers to use. 
- - How is Ethereum tackling the scalability issues?
  - I would point you to a recent post by Vitalik Buterin on Reddit. There he addresses the scalability of Ethereum. So no worries, Ethereums long term value is still ~0. Greg Maxwell, CTO of Blockstream and opponent of allowing Bitcoin to scale as Satoshi had planned. • r/btc 
- - How does the value of Ethereum, or Ripple increase when we invest in them?
  - This applies to everything, not just cryptocurrency. All other things being equal, when you buy something, there is less available. It becomes more scarce and therefore the price goes up. Cryptocurrency has a fixed supply, so even long term, firms can’t move into the space and increase supply as would happen with most things.

- - Is Ethereum ETH worth investing in as of May 26th, 2017 $176?
  - I’m gonna give you a pretty simple answer as a rule of thumb. Invest when nobody is talking about ETH and it looks like it’s hitting rock bottom. Sell when everyone is talking about it and the price is high. Right now is probably the worst possible time you could invest, just by the fact that you’ve become aware of it. Because there was apparently enough hype for you to learn about it, means its probably way overvalued because everyone like you wants to make a profit.

- - Will Ethereum survive the next generation smart contract based coins such as Cardano, etc.?
  - Original question ‘Will Ethereum survive the next generation smart contract based coins such as Cardano, etc.’ Smart contracts are one of the most important assets that cryptocurrencies brought to the table. They help users exchange money or anything else in value, while successfully avoiding middlemen as lawyers or banks. They provide security and speed of transactions while obliging everyone involved to respect rules and penalties which are agreed on. 
- - When will the Ethereum mining stop, and how it will affect the price? What are Ethereum miners going to do after that?
  - Ethereum miners will use their GPU’s for mining other coins, and Casper proof of stake protocol will be enabled. Then the security of the Ethereum network, will be kept by minting. 
- - What will the Ethereum price be by the end of July 2017?
  - Much less than it is today 07–15–2017. If the price continues to decline by $7$10/day, I’d say between $50$60. Once Bitcoin starts crashing harder, those who jumped on the Crypto pump will likely dump as well. Panic selling has already begun in case you haven’t noticed. 
- - How do Ethereum contracts prevent race conditions?
  - first make impossible running this procedure by setting some flag than send transaction if it was not done before set flag that transaction occured correctly if so then release first flag, that allows call this procedure

- - What is the difference between Ethereum and IBM Open Blockchain?
  - The economic difference is  Ethereum has put a quantity cap on itself. This currency is regulated by the source in quantity and turnover. This means it is regulated like Chinese Yuan, not only by offer and demand. IBM open Blockchain like Bitcoin is available in open quantity regulated only by offer and demand until the chain starts to repeat its values due to lack of diversification in 22 billion years. IBM cr@p unlisted. 
- - Who will win, Telegram Open Network TON or Ethereum technical & traction?
  - Hello, Jae! Since I know Pavel, who is he, what kind of person… I can tell that I don’t know the answer. Ethereum is pretty strong player on the market. Needless to say. BUT Pavel did great with Social Network VK that people mostly use in Russia. And then he moved to Japan and started Telegram… He is very smart person if not the smartest. In business and in software development. I see strong competitor to ETH. Also Ardor looks really dangerous for Ethereum. 
- - What are the chances of Hyperledger & Ripple working together to challenge Ethereum?
  - Much of silicon valley seems to be developing on Etherium, so I would say no 
- - Should I invest in Ethereum? Is it safe right now?

- - Will Ethereum Classic ETC become more popular once Ethereum ETH shifts to PoS? Miners who have invested substantial amounts into GPUs most profitable for Ethash will have to seek alternative mining options.
  - It is possible. Once mining stops for ETH, the shift of hashing power to ETC will increase, therefore increasing the difficulty. Both use the Ethash algorithm. I say it is possible and not certain because of the limited predictability in the Cryptocurrency world. Alt coins are rising and some people with powerful mining rigs are moving from ETH to those for a “mine and hold” strategy. Much of it depends on the person and if they prefer a particular algorithm. Hope that helps some. 
- - What is the best hardware configuration for hardware mining of Ethereum in India?
  - 1050 Ti is one of the best. Value for Money. ROI in 10 Months. We have tested it all. Most of the cards are expensive They may give you a Hash ranging from 38 Mh to 47 Mh but they are not worth the investment. I will advise gtx 1080Ti 6 GPUs rig with ASRock H81 Pro BTC motherboard and EVGA poer supply. Dont go with AMD in 2 months or so, amazing rx 580 which is making right now 30mh/s will be making 20mh/s and down the line to 12mh/s . 
- - Whats an example of a smart contract that works better on ethereum then a contract in every day life?
  - A “smart contract” is basically ANY transaction on the blockchain. So the question really is  how are blockchain transaction logs better than real world transaction logs. Here  a Any contracts which value provenance are great candidates for blockchain. Example, if you put property deeds on the blockchain, it is very easy for you to verify the antecedents of the property. In the real world, there will be missing links, risk for forged documents, etc  no such risk on the blockchain.

  - Bitcoin started in Jan 2009, and was in the doldrums for several years, before reaching the highs we see today. Ethereum started in 2013. In the past 4 years it has shot up to the high we see today.

  - Every time a user performs action or program is used on the network, every node on the network needs to agree that this action happened. Thats where the need for miners comes in. Their job is to use computing power to verify transactions taking place on blockchain, then adding them to a public ledger. This is preventing fraud and ensuring transactions are real. They are what makes the currency “decentralized” and cuts out the middleman. Then they are rewarded with Ether coins for their work. 
- - Why is Ethereum dropping compared to Bitcoin?
  - Because Bitcoin will soon go through the segwit2x fork which will create another fork. People are holding and buying to get the free coins.

Its like domino effect. Millionaire in blink of an eye. 
- - I want to invest in bitcoin or ethereum today. Which one and should I wait?
  - Investing should be taken seriously as you can certainly make mistakes that can be costly. So never invest more than you are willing to lose. Typically the funds that I place into an exchange are not used for anything other than a traditional savings account and I have found that I can earn far more from purchasing/selling coins than what my bank will provide in terms of interest. But please be careful, read everything twice and make sure you understand what you are doing. Good luck! 
- - What would be the effect of Microsofts Coco protocol on Ethereum price?
  - It should help raise it. When any major company partners with any new company or technology, it tends to raise the value of that company. That’s just “Business 101”. In the age of cryptocurrency, such things almost always raise the value of the associated currency. That’s one of the reasons why Bitcoin’s value has soared so much, recently major credibility gains in terms of adoption, funding, major statements from financial industry leaders both firms and people and so on. 
- - Can I use the same hardware to mine Ethereum and bitcoin?
  - There are 6 major differences between the two, which go as follows. With all these differences in mind, Ethereum surely looks to be quite the competitor. However, what one will use from among the two, or the other options that are coming up, will depend on the purpose as well as the secondary requirements of the two parties. 
- - Is it possible to brute force Ethereum private keys to open different wallets?
  - If you mean “possible by a nearly omniscient demigod”, the answer is “Probably not.” Before I explain why, consider this if it was possible to brute force Ethereum or Bitcoin wallets keychains storing private keys, why would anyone use Ethereum or Bitcoin? If they were insecure, no one would give them a second thought, right? Surely, no one would use public/private key cryptography if it were easy to break.

- - What caused the price of Ethereum to drop over the past few months?
  - I learnt about ethereum in September. Invested in December when it was around 8$, and right now the prices are around 200$ after touching a peak of 400$. So it depends on what timeline you are looking at, if you got in 6 months back its still 20 X. If you got in 2 months back, you’ll have around the same value. If you got in a month back, you may have lost around But like any market, cryptocurrencies are extremely unstable and have multiple reasons for their price movements.

Ethereum bets would be bigger once futures are launched since bitcoin will start being stable just like regulated products.

  - There are two, but one of them requires you to be in Hong Kong and the other one requires you be able to write some code.

  - Bitcoin. For Bitcoin you should wait for the price drop because in November there is a hard fork which is gonna cause a drop in the price of Bitcoin and then you can buy some Bitcoins if you want. If youre holding onto some Bitcoin then dont sell them because chances are when the hard fork comes the Bitcoin will divide again and you will the same amount of the split currency as the Bitcoin you are holding. Ethereum. 
- - Is it a good time to invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum? These are already at their lifetime high today.

- - What is the best and safest way to buy large amounts ~200k of Ethereum?
  - If you wanted to buy 200,000 ETH or 70 million dollars in ETH, it would be nearly impossible to get that amount quickly. Your best bet would be to go to an OTC exchange which deals in cryptocurrency. They specialize in large, multimillion dollar transactions, so it might be possible to get larger quantities there. However, youll probably have to do it over multiple transactions, as there are very few people who own anywhere close to 200K in ETH.

I believe if my maths is right, your money got 10X. 
- - What do you predict the price of Ethereum will be 50 years from now?
  - What if I told you price doesn’t matter in the long run? My prediction is $0 or the price will not exist. If it becomes so useful that people ditch USD there won’t be a price denominated in USD. If nobody ends up using it, eventually it will get abandoned. Anything in the middle is pretty hard to say because 50 years is a long time and no one can be certain. 
- - If Myspace succumbed to Facebook, what is preventing Bitcoin from succumbing to newer cryptocurrencies like BitcoinCash, Ethereum, or Litecoin?

- - How do I cash out the money I make from Bitcoin and/or Ethereum in the next 20 years?
  - If you’re a longterm holder, you won’t ever need to “cash out”. The same way you buy BTC / Ethereum. Exchanges typically have the option to both buy and sell them. If you don’t like to sell them at the price they tell you, you can set your own price by placing limit orders on GDAX or Poloniex. For example, you can place a sell limit order of 1 BTC at USD 5k. Somebody will eventually take your offer. At that time, the price of BTC will have risen to USD 5k.

  - The article says “ Overall, the group concluded that neither network “has strictly better properties than the other.”, so I don’t see why you conclude that Bitcoin is far more centralized. 
- - Why has ripple not moved up in value in spite of good news? Where is the trading volume that bitcoin and ethereum have?
  - No other major blockchain has that sort of power dynamic, which makes it difficult to trust their pricing long term. Glynn has a point, Coinbase doesn’t have direct XRP support, however Bitstamp does. I believe people are starting to realize banks rather develop on top of the ether tech. I briefly discuss it here in my new video series, Market Mondays.

  - The only place I know that exchanges cash for bitcoin is coinbase, check if they accept a bank account from Pakistan, otherwise you need a Paypal account that has money in it, then connect to coinbase, deposit money and then buy bitcoin. The problem here is that the fees for Paypal deposits are a bit high

Which makes quantum computers a big threat as one quantum computer can have a tremendous power over the network. 
- - What is the main difference between Ethereum & bitcoin?
  - Both are currencies based on blockchain technology, which means that they involve records that are stored on every computer that chooses to be a ‘node’. To become a node you would download the official Bitcoin or Ether client and download many, many gigabytes of every transaction that has ever happened since day one. Then your computer and all other nodes would look at every transaction anyone wants to make, and make sure the input/output balances add up. 
- - Should I get a Ledger Nano S wallet for my Ethereum or is Coinbase secure enough?
  - I would never trust an exchange hot wallet as there have been many historic cases of them being hacked and users funds being stolen, for example ‘Largest Cryptocurrency Exchange Hacked!

- - Which is the more beneficial investment to make a quick buck, Bitcoin ATM or Ethereum?
  - First of all you can’t be very rich in one night. If in 2010 you have invested in bitcoin and hold it until 2016–17 then definitely you must be very very rich. Right now if you have excess money and you just want to invest it then bitcoin is very good option.

On the other hand, if you completely lose your private key, then the Ethereum in your wallet is absolutely safe. It’s safe even from you. At this point, it’s completely useless since you cannot spend it without your private key.

- - I’m considering investing £2,000 in cryptocurrency, most likely Ethereum, then converting to OmiseGO. Is this an advisable strategy?
  - Great question. Yes. I have read the Omisego white paper . Omise is already in business with traditional payment method since 2013 and now they are integrating crypto wallet . so people dont need to use a bank account and gives holder an options to choose from fiat or any crypto which sounds amazing . Their tokes are called OMG also they have kept 5% for the ethereum holder , so if you are already holding thereum you will get some OMG tokens by default. 
- - What are the best resources for learning the tools for working with Ethereum?

- - Would you rather have 1 Bitcoin or the Ethereum equivalent in tokens at 8 right now?
  - Currently? The ethereum amount. Why? Because I think Ethereums approach to smart contracts is a valuable one. The technology base is sound. The mathematical approach to proof of stake is tricky but promising. I think it will grow faster than Bitcoin in the next years. Take that with a grant of salt! I’m not an investor and it’s still high speculative business! I would choose ethereum, because its going to get as popular as bitcoin yet its at a lower value. More profits to be declared.

- - Would a 16 GTX 1050Ti Ethereum/Zcash miner be worth it?
  - It is worth it as long as you can spend your time maintaining it, with 24 hour power supply, internet, cooling etc. Its a huge risk, even if one of the cards fail and burn out, you will be losing a lot of your investment considering that it takes 9 months to 1 year to get back coins worth your investment. 
- - Does the recent DAO hack of Ethereum mean that the blockchain is not as secure as we thought?
  - No, That is not the case at all. It was not the blockchain that was hacked, it was a loop in a contract written on top of a blockchain that was exploited. no dofferent to a loop hole in a written contract. Technically the hacker did nothing wrong and simply made use of a loop hole, really just some badly written code, in order to gain control of a large amount of funds. 
- - What are some of the long-term potential benefits of Ethereum and other blockchain technologies?
  - They will minimize transaction cost clearance. No need for bureaucratic organizations to keep registered databases, as special purpose blockchains can handle all that stuff.  A blockchain is a cost effective way to add data that are proved  by the blockchain entries themselves. I can prove that I made an invention because it is added to an inventions blockchain, or I can prove trademark ownership, by my private keys to the transaction that added it, to a trademarks blockchain. I can have an application to scan the trademarks blockchain to see if my logo is already used and issued by someone else before.

  - Cheers! If Ethererum could be mined with ASICs then the price would likely go down for a couple reasons. 
- - Can an Ethereum based smart contract application be worth more than ETH itself?
  - From my understanding yes, of course this is possible. Here’s why ETH is a “currency” yes. But remember, it’s also the original, let’s say protocol that most AltCoins are based off of. The smart contract for new AltCoins, let’s say XYZ123Coin  is completely different than the “code / protocol” that it’s written on. Phrased another way…it’s like asking could Microsoft Windows be worth more than the C++ I think that was the language? it was initially written with? Answer is yes, absolutely. 
- - So whos into Ethereum?
  - I am more in the study stage with this coin but I’d take some if your giving some away P Ether seems to be rather strong and the on blockchain features are pretty cool.

- - Whats the current hash rate required to mine a Bitcoin and Ethereum on a daily basis?
  - Right now, I have a machine mining ether with an NVIDIA 1080 GPU. The hash rate is about 20,000,000 hashes per second. This makes about $3 per day. With Bitcoin, you’ll need a lot more hashes / sec. My friend’s miner gets about 10 terahashes / sec, and is able to make about the same. For bitcoin is over 15,16 PH/s = 1250+ S9 Antminers For ethereum is 13 GH/s = 75+ best possible ETH miners 6 card 1080Ti configuration Date 04/19/2018

People kept coming back after these suggestions for multiple reasons, the Docs are too dry and difficult to follow, or the MOOC is paid, or it is just an overview. We curate best solidity tutorial and stories from all over the medium. 
- - Is ethereum code genuine?
  - In 2011 , 19 year old Vitalik Buterin was working on different Bitcoin projects, at that time he was inspired by some of the shortcomings he faced when trying to build applications on the Bitcoin blockchain and got the idea of Ethereum. which is a robust platform for developers to build blockchain applications. In 2013, Ethereum white paper was released and it documented a new opensource protocol for creating decentralized applications. 
- - Is buying Ethereum in India illegal under FEMA?
  - No,It is not illegal, but the RBI has also mentioned that it must be in the own individual risk which means government wont be responsible if you get into financial trouble due to the currency nor does it make it crime to do the trade. 
- - Is it possible to buy drugs with Ethereum?
  - In lilife ANYTHING is possible, and Im not sure of type of payment accepted, I know btc for sure but on dark Web u can buy anything you can imagine, just Google dark Web and accepted Ted types of payment, but be careful, I know people sitting in prison for the type of transactions your inquiring about, I think it has to get pretty steep before they come take u away, but its immparative to remember my opening statement here. Do not go being wise in your own eyes. 
- - Which country is the cheapest place to run an Ethereum or bitcoin miner?
  - The only factor that affects whike mining is electricity. From my concern, Iceland and Ukraine  $0. 04 per kWh. A futuristic approach towards bitcoin mining using renewable energy has been made in practical by Bitmain  A Beijing based company. https//blog.bitmain.com/en/bitm... 
- - Is Bitcoin considered a more conservative investment than Ethereum?
  - It is because it has been out for 7 years and the rise from last year to this yea is only 100%. As good as that may be, coins like Ethereum, Ripple, Dash, etc…went up 1000%+. That is why Bitcoin is seen as more conservative. But overall Btc is going to be the standard the world adopts first before all other coins and the potential is still enormous. 
- - Whats the best Litecoin/Bitcoin/Ethereum miner I can buy for $600-800 CAD?
  - Don’t waste your money on miners, they are either very outdated or not worth the price. Build your own mining rig, with about 800 CAD you can build a nice rig with 2 GPUS. best prices on miners That’s not worth the money for $600–800. Invest in the currency directly. It’s going to be very cumbersome to have a room with 1/2 GPUs overheating. Either spend $10k and get a nice setup or simply don’t mine. 
- - Which cryptocurrency/Blockchain for Dapps is the biggest competitor to Ethereum, EOS, Cardano, NEM, Tron?
  - Well, I think Ethereum is the king in case of dapps development. Other cryptocurrencies have emerged but none has topped ETH yet. No wonder ETH is facing resilient competition from upcoming cryptocurrencies. But still it has managed to be on the top position. 
- - With the crash thats going on, should I sell my 2.5 Ethereum or hold on to it?
  - Based on the technical analysis and history the Bitcoin is expected to rebound around the 3200 range. The same applies to Ethereum. Since Ethereum doesnt have so much of history. I have pulled up the Bitcoin Chart. Bitcoin has regularly had a 30% pull back. This time is no different, $3200 is around the 34% pull back. 
- - Why are cryptocurrencies dropping in price? I thought people were exchanging to Ethereum in preparation for the fork bonus, but now they are all dropping.
  - No. No one was preparing for the fork bonus. Infact, there was an effort to move onto the next baseline, which could be ethereum. As we all know that did not work out well. If I start talking in terms of ‘technical analyses’ bitcoin lost its last lower support at $13k we are seeing a huge drop in the prices. Not all cryptocurrencies are dropping. Apparently, USD Tether is 20% up. The euphoria still went on and that’s how you know it’s a bubble. The Crypto market tumbled for three reasons. 
- - If the US defaulted on its debt, what would the impact be on cryptocurrencies Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc?
  - There really does seem to be one born every minute doesnt there? And were not just talking about crypto currencies here either….boom, boom! From tulips to penny stocks to cryptocurrencies, like any prospective bubble there will always be people who make money from talking things like this up not least by those already heavily invested in them but there will also, by definition, ultimately be many more losers than winners. 
- - On Coinbase, is Ethereum transferred to another Ethereum taxable?
  - No, as its not resulting in any gains and sole purpose is changing its place, it is not taxable. 
- - Is it too late to mine for Ethereum and how much would it cost to mine an ethereum?
  - No it is not late. Ethereum mining is still profitable under certain conditions. And yes you can still mine Ethereum and make profits easily. It is said that Ethereum mining will be stopped soon. Once ETH mining is stopped you can switch to Ethereum classic. You’ll need a mining rig to get started. You can buy it from any Indian ecommerce websites or you can build one yourself. If you want to successfully mine Ethereum make sure these points meet. Links you might want to read 
- - Where can I trade ETH Ethereum call options?
  - I have not seen Ethereum call options; that said, closer to an Ether call options you will get is a leveraged position on ETH on one of the exchanges. Yes, this is not the same as a stock option and arguably carries more risk given the large amount of borrowed funds required get to get a similar payout to an option. To illustrate how this works, suppose you want to buy 5 ETH on borrowed funds. Also, let’s assume during the time you hold the position the price of ETH appreciates 20%, resulting a total of 6 ETH at the time of closing the position. Your return is the 1 ETH from the 20% price increase on your position less the interest on the borrowed 5 ETH. Note  when you close the position, you also return the initial borrowings of 5 ETH. 
- - Which is the best to invest in 2018, Verge or Ethereum?
  - The choice is difficult, and people want simple answers, and also they want predictions of the future. Everyone that tells you they know the future, or what will be big, is a fraud. Study the projects, and invest in the ones you believe in most, preferably many. 
- - Do you agree that it finally is useless to invest/gamble in altcoins and that the focus must be only in good ICOs, and of course in Bitcoin and Ethereum?
  - Any investment has risk. The whole cryptocurrency gold rush/money grab/free money party going on right now is being fueled by many factors. Less high paying jobs, economic uncertainty, media hype, gambler mentality we as humans all have, etc. No one wants to miss out on becoming the next millionaire. 
- - Will Ethereums proof of stake release kill Ethereums mining opportunities?
  - Original Question Will Ethereums proof of stake release kill Ethereums mining opportunities? Not at all. It just changes their structure. Under the current proofofwork structure, miners solve complex math problems with their computers the work that proves their qualification to validate transactions  to determine which blocks should be added to the blockchain. 
- - Will other emerging cryptocurrencies destroy the value of Bitcoin and Ethereum?
  - As for Bitcoin, the threats are threefold So while it doesn’t seem likely at this point, there are scenarios that we might imagine could hurt Bitcoin in favor of new cryptocurrencies. 
- - Why did Vitalik Buterin create Ethereum, another cryptocurrency? Why didnt he upgrade bitcoin to make it a platform for Dapps and smart contracts?
  - That would not have been an upgrade, it would have been a change to a different use case, leaving a vacuum for a new system to support the original use case. Why didn’t jet planes replace cars? Aren’t jet planes much faster and better than cars? But people still have to get to work every day and a car is better for that purpose. It makes more sense to have cars to get to and from work every day and also jet planes for getting across the country. 
- - How profitable is it to start a mining Ethereum today, May 27th, 2017 with a MinerGate cloud?
  - The worth of mining completely depends on your perspective, what type of gain you are looking for, type of investments you are doing etc. It has a of parameters to consider. Let’s discuss the parameters first that affect mining returns 
- - What are the best apps for earning free Ethereum?
  - Ith has 30+paying ways i.e If you want free cryptocurrencies you’ll have to make use of free mining websites. These websites will ask you to enter your public key, and once done you’ll be deposited a small amount of free cryptocurrencies. Some of them will give you direct access and some of them will ask you to make a small fee. Above is a link to the list of free Ethereum mining websites. If you want to know how to invest and trade you can read the below linked articles. 
- - What is the minimum cost for Ethereum mining?
  - The cost of Ethereum mining rigs vary based on the graphics cards, motherboard, processor etc. You can get one running for about $2400. Alternatively you can check Bitmain’s E3 miner. 
- - Why would someone develop an app on top of ethereum?
  - Cause its a new form of interaction for people where the principles of gamification or even gambling in a way if you like are organically implemented on this new type of internet. Automation works on a greater scale, helping increase the desired effect. People develop new internal economics dependable on the supporting and demanding community where individuals unite by interests. DAPS are more flexible to community needs having access to a vast variety of resources available on global blockchain. 
- - I want to invest in Ethereum in 2018. Am I late to the party?
  - No, Not At All. Infact, Ethereum Still has A 100–150x Market Cap Capability. As On Today,Market Cap Of Ethereum Was around 76.4 Billion Dollars.2nd On The List. It Increased 5700% In the year 2017 Rising From 760 million dollars To 45 Billion Dollars at the end of the year. Crypto Market Has A Capacity To Reach 40 Trillion Dollars In The Next 10 Years, Says Pantera Capital CEO. 40 Trillion Dollars !! 100x From Now. 
- - How do I buy Ethereum in Australia?
  - Hope this helps. Cheers, Jaxx 
- - How can we do Ethereum address validation?
  - Ever wondered why your Ethereum Address has both upper case and lower case letters. This casesensitivity of Ethereum Addresses is used for checksum validation. In simpler terms, checksum validation is a way to tell if an address is valid and prevent typos while entering an address. In this article, we shall look into the details of how Ethereum addresses are checksummed. At the end of the article, we shall provide a tool that validates an address using the checksum. 
- - How do I buy Ethereum in Malaysia?
  - You can exchange your bitcoin to ethereum in coinlab.trade 
- - How much Ethereum can I mine with a set of Rs. 10,000? How much of a return can I get in the long run?
  - Ether mining requires a mining rig consisting of at least four to five GPU’s graphic processing units or more commonly know as Graphics card and each qualifying graphics card can cost you around 30–35k. So let’s say you need 5 GPU each of 30k approx. plus you will need a motherboard, smps to power the mining rig that can cost you around 5–6k plus you will need to have a hardisk to store your mined coins that will cost you around 3k also you will need qualifying RAM and a couple of other accesories. 
- - What is the most clever decision do you consider- investing in Ripple or investing in Ethereum?
  - This is a very complex question, and it’s next to impossible to give a definite answer. The reason being all of these have their pros and cons and virtually no one can give you more than a speculation. Here are the main points about all of these currencies If you are interested in buying cryptocurrencies, you can visit www.CoinSwitch .co. They have supported 275+ coins over 45,000+ currency pairs from multiple exchanges . 
- - How is Ethereum Classic still relevant when most of the Dapps are created on the Ethereum network?
  - The developers are turning ETC into more of a coin than Ethereum is. And it stills has mining worth. The team behind ETC has a different roadmap now I think, so it may increase in value mid term, but I don’t really find it long term powerful. It grows because everything grows. 
- - Is there an equivalent of Bitcoinwisdom price charts for Ethereum?
  - Many. 
- - What were some of the most compelling arguments against Ethereum in its very early days?
  - As a large investor in the Ethereum ICO, I can tell you there were very few compelling arguments not to invest in the project at the time. Especially if you had been involved in JR Willet’s creation  Mastercoin  the forerunner to Ethereum and the first ICO and first blockchain based smart contract. Mastercoin’s main shortcoming was that it was built on top of the bitcoin blockchain. The blockchain core devs really didn’t appreciate having an intelligence layer built into bitcoin. An interesting story in itself but off topic here. But it was clearly a powerful idea. Which is why devs working on Mastercoin moved to the Ethereum project to try building another blockchain based smart contract, but this time on a purpose built blockchain. But to attempt to answer your question about compelling reasons existed to not invest in the Ethereum ICO, I can only give you one. But it was a big one. By the time of the Ethereum ICO in 2014, bitcoin and other crypto currencies were under full assault by government bureaucrats and large corporations who feared its impact on society. They feared losing their strangle hold on how their citizens make payments and store wealth. Federal law enforcement and regulatory agencies across the world were attacking companies using crypto currencies and many were attempting to criminalize its use. Some of the largest governments in the world were openly hostile to the use of blockchain based currencies. In this climate of intrusive government actions against law abiding citizens who were simply looking for a better way to hold and exchange value between others, it was not obvious that investing in Ethereum was a smart idea. My guess is that the majority of people who knew about the Ethereum ICO, but who did not participate in it, declined for this reason. There was just such a government induced climate of fear during that period. One final comment about the Ethereum ICO. Shortly after ETH was distributed to the ICO partcipants and began trading, it collapsed. If I recall correctly ETH began trading at about 25.6 cents each. Then spiked to over 40 cents and then plunged to 15 cents to 20 cents. Those who participated in the ICO were still up, since they got in at about 5 cents an ETH. But ETH was by no means an instant hit. It went up nicely over the next 12 months  July 2015 to July 2016. But also had a habit of dropping by 50% every month or so. After the DAO fiasco, ETH dropped from $22 to $10 and all the way down to $6 or so in early December 2016. Nearly all of its now $40 billion market cap was created in 2017. 
- - Why do initial coin offerings drive up the price of ethereum?
  - Answer to this question is very simple Currently most of the ICO  initial coin offering  as using ERC20 tokens for the crowdsale in their ICO, which is formed using smart contract and these contracts are running on gas provided by ether. So many people are buying ethereum to buy the tokens in ICO which are driving up the price of ethereum. 
- - What fees does Ethereum charge for developing a cryptocurrency?
  - 1 Eth, but you will have to know some coding, even though they say you don’t. If you don’t know coding and don’t want to spend 200+ $ for a test, I suggest you try waves. You can create tokens for 1 WAV 3–4$ and it’s literally a child’s play. None. Its an open source protocol that can be developed by anyone. 
- - Do we think Ethereum will hit $100 USD before or around 1st August?
  - You may find this Ethereum trade I have just entered interesting https//steemit.com/eth/@supertr... Sean Vengan, Cryptotrader and Trading Educator httpcryptotradingmasterycom Nopes after the current dip, the next stage of etherum is to go up.. Despite Daily variation between 200$and 225$ the etherum is surely gonna cross 350$ soon by September It is very unlikely but you never know.. Guess we will have to see.. 
- - What are the steps for creating smart contracts in Ethereum?
  - All you need to work on Ethereum are its tokens, called ethers, that cover expenses for using computational performance. To connect to Blockchain and become a network participant download some Ethereum digital wallet, e.g., Mist, enabling to issue your own tokens, manage user accounts, and use decentralized applications. 
- - What are the major differences between these two crypto-currency 2.0 platforms Ethereum vs NXT?
  - Major diffrence between NXT and Ethereum is their ideology to create a token Ethereum focus on smart contract and NXT focus on Assets. In ethereum smart contract, you can comunicate between smart contract. For example, You have 2 smart contract, smart contract A and smart contract B, both of them can communicate each others. In nxt blockchain, you only can create asset/your own token, but so far as i know you can not communicate between two assets. CMIIW pls. 
- - What is the best/cheapest way to buy Bitcoin/Ethereum/Litecoin with currency?
  - If you have Bit coin You can buy all other Cryptocurrencies from coinswitch .co, they are a Cryptocurrency and Altcoin exchange aggregator. Coin switch is the first cryptocurrency and altcoin exchange aggregator. They have integrated with many leading exchanges across the globe to provide the best exchange rates to their users. Currently, we support over 275 cryptocurrencies and more than 45000 pairs to exchange. I always use these option that I alway use —— 
- - If I create a new Ethereum address, is this possible that the new address already exist?
  - Okay, in theory, yes, it is technically possible for your wallet to generate an identical address to someone else on the network. The likelihood of this happening is on the order of you winning the Powerball about 9 times in a row, but that’s besides the point. 
- - With the up and coming Ethereum fork, which exchanges are supporting the split which in turn guarantees you 11?
  - The only way to guarantee your forked coins, is, to have them in a wallet that you control, like MyEtherWallet. If you have them in an exchange wallet, you are in the exchange’s policy control. If they choose to support the fork, you’ll have the coins. If not you won’t get them. 
- - Is it recommended to invest in Ethereum now, given the upcoming fork in September, or will the price go down ahead of the upgrade?
  - There is no way to say. It could go up, down, sideways, no one knows. If you believe in Ethereum, invest in it. Sure it could go up or down $50 at the fork but in the long run, it’s going to keep going up. If you believe in the technology and the team, invest. If you don’t want to take the risk, then don’t invest. It’s that simple. Ethereum created smart contracts and for that reason, I think it’s a great investment. 
- - Is it time to ditch Bitcoin, and convert it into Altcoins? Which Altcoin will be the best bet? What about Ethereum?
  - I think there’s tonnes of potential in the altcoin markets, and agree that Ethereum and Litecoin are on the safe side  The cryptocurrency markets are often correlated at the moment so it can be a bit tough to move coins around a the right time when one is high and the other is low. Thanks! 
- - I currently hold 1.4 Bitcoin, 170 Ethereum, 52 Litecoin and 870 Omisego. What is the likelihood of my portfolio tripling in value in the next 6-12 months?
  - I think LTC will reach be between DASH and ETH is by this time next year. ETH has the possibility of making a similar run to that of BTC, but I DON’T expect it to blast through that 10K run the same way. But I do think that it may follow that initial path where we saw BTC finally move from 700 to 1k, 2k and 4K. If it does other speculators will take a chance investing believing there is “meat on the bone” between 4 and 10K. The coin that I don’t see tripling during that time is BTC… but Oh how I wouldn’t mind. Omisego, like BTC is the one I think is the hardest to anticipate. But based on how other coins I have in similar price ranges I am very optimistic that it should be able to triple because mentally it will be in a price range that more investors can stomach. Newbies to crypto will see the penny coins as risky and too young in the market to invest too much. BTC, ETH, LTC. XMR, DASH etc… will be too expensive for them to own a large bundle of full coins. mentally people like being able to own full coins and not just .0124 of a coin. Easier to tell people about and looks more glamorous. REMEMBER for many people, investing is still a discussion topic and it is “Cool” to own 16 full coins as opposed to a weird fraction. 
- - What exchange has the lowest fees to buy with US cash, Ethereum or Bitcoin?
  - There are hundreds of Exchanges but I would recommend using the following. I would not trust other with my credit card and bank details etc. CEX.IO Coinmama These exchanges facilitate OTF transactions. Their verification process is quick and easy as compared to other. They usually charge ±7%. 
- - There was a huge drop in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices. Should we sell or hold, considering the drop on June 12–15, 2017?
  - Do you believe in cryptocurrency? Do you believe that they will change the future for the better? Do you think they’re just getting started or do you think they’ve peaked in their value to the world? I think this is just the beginning. My bet would be on hold. 
- - Is the Ethereum app safe?
  - Coinbase wallet is safe wallet, you can store Bitcoin, Ethereum and LTC in one wallet 
- - Ethereum or ripple? I have ether worth $4000, should I hold on to it and for how long?
  - There seem to be more and more use cases for smart contracts and decentralized applications dapps surfacing every day. Because of this, I think investments into smart contract platforms like Ethereum, Neo, Icon, etc.. are some of the best ones you can make. 
- - How much Ethereum do you need to purchase to get Proof of Stake?
  - Although the details of Casper have not been finalized, it sounds like there will not be a hard limit on the amount of Ether required to become a validator in the proofofstake protocol. Vitalik has argued that having multiple validator pools, each with its own limit on number of validators and minimum deposit size, would reduce risk to the system [1]. 
- - How does Ethereum makes sure their is no malware smart contract running in the Blockchain network?
  - It depends on the attack vector. Kostas answer covers the fact that you can not run a looping contract for ever that saturates the network. What else malware could there be? Scams the contract has a backdoor where someone can steal all the money. This is hard to verify at this stage of the security tools available. But potentially a maleware scanner could detect many holes via ‘static analysis’ of the source code and flaging it on a website or even a reputation smart contract. 
- - Which Ethereum multi-sig wallet is the safest?
  - There may of course be different answers to this question but I would say that the Ethereum Mist Wallet is considered very safe. There are a lot of wallets out there with an easier user interface but check out Ethereum Mist and see if it works for your needs. Good luck! 
- - What are the technical differences between Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum? What are their blockchain details?
  - BITCOIN The block chain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies. All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography. 
- - Will Ethereums proof of work to proof of stake change affect its price?
  - We have all heard stories about how the Bitcoin Blockchain is now consuming more electricity than several countries put together. Ever stop to wonder why that might be the case. That’s largely because of the consensus algorithm that Bitcoin Blockchain uses to ensure safety and immutability of data. Read on to learn more about it. Proof of work 
- - Where can I buy Ethereum ETH/Ether in Denmark?
  - You can buy ETH coin from Coin switch [dot] co at best rates. They provide a sameless experience by integrating with reliable and secure exchanges. Here is the step by step guide to exchange coins from CoinSwitch https // blog [dot] coinswitch [dot] co/coin switchexchangetutorial 274acaca10a9. I recommend coinomi, a multi cryptocurrency wallet for Android and PC or Mac. Good luck. Be sure to follow our blog. It is easier, faster to buy bitcoin then convert it to Eth via an exvhanger. 
- - Why is Bitcoin still number 1 in the crypto world, given other coins such as Ethereum, Litecoin have better properties than it?
  - Ill list a few reasons below and while it is the leader, it doesnt mean it will stay the leader in whatever comes next for crypto but thats all part of the fun. There are many other reasons but these were the key ones that come to mind for me. The space is so broad that your question cant really be answered easily. In general, altcoins are far more risky but offer more potential reward. In general, altcoin portfolios will require far more management to safely retain value. 
- - How was GPU mining before Ethereum? Do you consider it profitable as a long-term investment?
  - Just before ETH, GPU mining wasn’t really profitable I guess. In fact, it had been used for Bitcoin mining, but then, way more profitable ASIC replaced it. So between BTC mining on GPU and Ethereum there wasn’t much to do. I mining for approximately 1 year now. Now, speaking about profitability you have to consider two things 
- - Which of the digital currencies can be expected to be in wide use apart from Bitcoin and Ethereum?
  - No cryptocurrency has achieved the goal of being accepted in a large percent of physical stores. Bitcoin will be the first because of its headstart and position as a household word, but the second and third are up for grabs. It will be years before any currency is taken in more than 20% of stores, so it is impossible to predict early on. Litecoin could be second because of its age. Ehtereum could be second due to its popularity and security. Perhaps Ripple or Dash. 
- - How high is the probability of Ethereum Classic getting $100 per coin? Why?
  - In my opinion it is unlikely. The founders have all moved to Ethereum and no exchange wants to carry Ethereum Classic because the blocks are all essentially the same. That means you would basically have double the money if an exchange had both Ethereum and Ethereum classic. 
- - What do you think will increase in value the most in the near future Bitcoin or Ethereum?
  - Considering Ethereum was hit the most by the recent price declines, and, the changes that are to come, which were planned from the beginning to improve growth, I believe Ethereum will increase in value more than Bitcoin. In fact, I’ve invested my recent gains in Bitcoin, in Ethereum. Also, I subscribe to the belief of many experts in the technologies, that Ethereum will surpass Bitcoin in market capitilization within two years, or sooner. That’s some serious growth! Shawn Murphy 
- - Besides the proof-of-work mining method, are there any other possible methods of generating new units of a cryptocurrency on the Ethereum platform?
  - Possible methods? No. There is not method. There are two methods under which a cryptocurrency is made available. Checking Desc Yes, only mining. No except above mentioned two ones. Ethereum chain currently uses Proof of Work as the only mining option . 
- - Was Ethereum ever free?
  - Do you mean “Was Ether the currency of the Ethereum Network ever free?” Answer No, Ether was sold in an ICO for about 0.30$ per ETH Do you mean “Was the Ethereum platform ever free to use?” Answer No, you always have to pay a fee to run SmartContracts or to send transactions. 
- - When will Ethereums scaling problem be solved?
  - Last year there were discussions about implementing lightning network and sharding. I haven’t heard much about it since then. Now the big focus is moving towards POS rather than POW. It will always be a lingering problem to some degree, the nature of the beast you just have to deal with it. 
- - If we create a new blockchain of ethereum and opened a new account, can we sell our ethereum when required? If yes how can I transfer to my ethereum wallet?
  - If you create new blockchain, then it will create new currency, and it will not be connected to ethereum. But I think you made a mistake in question and want to create a contract on ethereum blockchain. When you create a new contract, contract becomes wallet too. You can send ETH and tokens to it, but you will be able to take it from contract only if you instructed contract when created. Ethereum contract is created using solidity programming language. 
- - Where would you direct a beginner to learn about Ethereum mining?
  - Hey, There are many places where you can learn more about Ethereum Mining. Some other places with some decent info are Greetings and success! 
- - Does Gordon Miller invest in cryptocurrency like Ethereum or Bitcoin? What is some advice in either of the two for anyone with limited resources?
  - Dont know about Gordon miller , but there are many world class venture capitalist like Tim draper, Vinny lingham investing and betting on bitcoin ethereum. These both the Tokens represent siginificant share in the crypto market cap and promise to bring huge change in financial structure in future. however i suggest do your own research before investing anything, Crypto is a new technology, unregulated by govt. there is no one expert here, and no one can give a invest advice here. hope this helps. 
- - What is the reason for the latest ethereum price spike starting 12th of March 2017?
  - This is a huge announcement for investors and the Ethereum community as a whole because it signals widespread interest in Ethereum and confirmed investment into Ethereum application and infrastructure development from leading international software providers. A second goal of the Alliance is to experiment with “new governance models designed to give the kind of control regulated enterprises need”, said Jeremy Millar the founder of the Alliance. This he believes would further empower a selforganizing network effect to further develop Ethereum infrastructure. 
- - How does an Ethereum Validator validate a block? For regular mining, puzzled are solved, justifying the validity of the Blockchain. How is a validator bringing value to the Ethereum Blockchain? What is proof of stake solving algorithmically?
  - I can try and help, even though you will not get any tech savvy terms from me. This was explained to me once briefly by a blockchain developer. Mining ETH is making blocks. You get rewarded for making a good block in the blockchain, whilst a bad block would get you punished somehow. 
- - What is bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and ripple trading for?
  - Hope this helps! 
- - Is it better to invest in Ethereum or EOS? Is EOS a better investment than Ethereum?
  - Good question… and if I were you I would ignore any answers on here that suggest which one you should pick. The first rule in Crypto is DYOR do your own research so that is my answer for you. Ethereum is the number 2 biggest crypto, it’s the first mainstream block chain platform for launching ICO and Dapps and will likely stay big for a long time to come. You see predictions of $15,000 for ETH this year which are definitely possible, but so it is dropping to $100 
- - Do you think Ethereum will grow even more for the next year?
  - In my opinion, yes it will. It will gain the recognition that it deserves. So will Bitcoin, Litecoin and probably DASH. Go for it, get in while you can, do not sit on the fence, getting wood splinters where you do not want them, waiting for an inexpensive price, it never comes. What I mean by that is, you may see a price drop and 9 times out of 10, people will put off buying then because they are looking for a further dip. 
- - How do founders of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum make money?
  - When you launch these CRYPTOCURRENCY ,they are designed such hat some percent of total volume is alloted to founders ,some to the team and some for marketing and development of project in the starting. Lets take etherum,its founder is VITALIK BUTERIN.When he will design the crypto he could allot 10%percent of eth to himself ,20,%percent to team ,20% for development and marketing and rest for the ICO. 
- - How do I move Ethereum I bought through Coinbase into a safer wallet?
  - The reason why Coinbase is considered “unsafe” is because of incidents like the MtGox hack that resulted in everyone losing there BTC. Centralization has its issues. If you want an even higher level of control, you can use MyEtherWallet, a client side wallet generator that is the gold standard of personal wallets. You can generate a public key, move your wallet into cold storage and move on. 
- - Is it a good idea to begin coding on Ethereum?
  - Sure, why not.  Ethereum presents some compelling next gen capabilities on blockchains, smart contracts and computational theory. It has good and growing support from a variety of sources and is likely to continue its evolution in a dynamic ecosystem for value tech. Even if you do t stick with it the learnings could assist you with whatever emerges next. 
- - What will happen to other cryptocurrencies when Ethereum switches to proof-of-stake, assuming large amounts of hashing power are refocused?
  - Other cryptocurrency prices will rise as miners move over. The miners who have held their ETH may decide to participate in PoS. I personally believe Ethereum Classic will be mined more as it’s essentially the same code. We could see classic pump. I’ve recently set up a slack channel for the crypto community  Join BlockMastery here. Oh, good question! 
- - In what ways if any does Ethereum as a platform to launch ICOs pose US securities law issues?
  - A donut could be used as a security if parties agree. In the case of a donut share, the donut must be registered or comply with the SEC regs. The Howey test is a good place to start in determining whether your token is a security or not based on your use case. I get multiple calls a day from people wanting to launch an ICO, and after my first question, “That’s great, what do you want your token and application to do?”, it pretty much sorts out the bullshittery from the legit. 
- - Why is Ethereum range bound Sept 27 2017?
  - Breakout today. $307. can go as high as $320–330. WIth Metropolis out within 1–1.5 months it can go to $400. Remember, that eth market cap is close to $30 billion! 
- - Which is better, bitcoin, Ethereum or ripple for a long term investment of 4 to 5 years?
  - I feel Bitcoin has great potential for a long term investment. There are experts who had rightly predicted BITCOIN to reach US$ 3000 says that it has great potential to reach 10,000$ by 2021. Today, Bitcoin price has come down but Bitcoin community have great faith in this crypto currency to surpass and break another record. Ethereum too is going to offer promising returns in the coming years. Let’s hope for the best. I am sharing above information based on various chat groups / experts opinion. 
- - What is the easiest way to buy Ripple or Ethereum? How does it work, and can these websites be trusted?
  - It’s probably smart to get involved with cryptos. Plus it’s away to diversify ones portofilio and not a scary as some may think. best places for beginners to buy Ripple will be exchange sites that take fiat paper nonback currency like the USD. Any exchange that takes USD will be heavily regulated and have sign up applications just like a fidelity or etrade type sites 
- - Would a contract deployed on a blockchain, like Ethereum, hold up in a court of law?
  - By default no, as contract deployed to blockchain is a piece of code, but not some physical contract actual representation. And if smart contract is written correctly, it should no need any court interruption, as contract itself should be able to solve all cases i.e. money transfers according to some rules etc. Also, there is many projects working on the legal part of smart contract and making them viable in a legal way. It doesn’t have to. 
- - Is a $50 billion market cap for Ethereum feasible?
  - It’s possible, but I expect it would happen 5–10 years down the line. Since ether is most commonly purchased with cryptocurrencies instead of legal tender, its value is inextricably linked to the price of bitcoin. Bitcoin’s market cap is approaching 9 billion this week, Ethereum’s is a little over a billion. Assuming the ratio of these market caps remains constant I personally think it’s going to decrease as ether is more widely adopted, bitcoin’s market cap will have to rise to almost half a trillion. This will not happen until Bitcoin undergoes a true mainstream breakthrough. 
- - I am totally new to trading Ethereum. What should I know?
  - First thing you should know that Ethereum is not a cryptocurrency. Ether is. Okay, now let’s look into things that you should know before investing in Ethereum Happy Investing. Ethereum ETH A platform designed for running smart contracts, Ethereum was built in 2014 using blockchain technology. Ethereum allows online transactions to be made safely and securely, with almost zero risk of fraud or interference. It’s an appealing concept, and many investors are realizing its value. 
- - Whats the reasoning behind exponential increases in value for Bitcoin and Ethereum?
  - It’s also a powerful system with a world of flexibility. This is what makes Ether superior to Bitcoin in the eyes of many analysts, technophiles, and investors. Bitcoin was the original cryptocurrency. It came out of nowhere, popping up on a niche mailing list of cryptography nerds. Content Director For Cryptosomniac Cryptocurrencies ————————————————————————————— 
- - What is the future like for Blockchain and Ethereum? Will they be able to stand the test of time in economic vagaries of demand and supply?
  - Probably not… But then if someone had asked me if the USD could have survived the introduction of the Federal Reserve, and dropping of the gold and silver standards I would have also thought the answer was no. 
- - What price should I sell Ethereum at?
  - This primarily boils down to two situations If you’re short then the answer is obvious; sell now to try and maximize your returns from your initial investments. If you’re long then the answer is obvious; hold and continue to do so. In fact, right now might even make for a fantastic buying opportunity if you believe Ethereum will eventually rebound price is currently sitting around 530 USD. 
- - Should I buy Ethereum for a long term investment? Is there any other cryptocurrency which is profitable to invest in at this moment?
  - Alright, let’s get to reality. Long term investment = Trust. You need to trust and have faith in technology to invest. People who gave some good list of bitcoin, investment, and etc. barely understand the power of Ethereum. Well let’s see. You want to buy Ethereum Network Token for long term investment. I suggest you can carry on. Because you are investing in a technology, not some shitty firms or company. 
- - Will Ethereum reach new all-time highs?
  - Yes, definitely. Ethereum takes the most useful part of the Bitcoin out of the currency. It allows you to decentralize anything and create contracts that dictate the behavior of data and assets. Ethereum is essentially becoming a platform to decentralize anything. That’s why it was created. It will allow for a new type of internet that cannot be regulated, but is still consumer friendly. 
- - What kind of events could completely obliterate the markets for Bitcoin / Ethereum?
  - A market is very hard to obliterate. Markets are like languages. Markets are institutions. It’s something created in peoples mind. 
- - Do Ethereum app developers get rewarded with ether?
  - Learn How to Build a Crowd Sale ICO App in Ethereum Blockchain from the industry experts. In this course they will show you a step by step process of creating a Crowd sale application. At the end of this course you will be able to launch your own ICO application in Ethereum and also extend it as per your need. 
- - How does one get started with Bitcoin/Ethereum cloud mining?
  - hi you can invest in cloud mining which is much more profitable than a mining rig or simple CPU or GPU mining. Here are the reasons you don’t have to worry about mining softwares or electricity costs you don’t have to work any amount as once purchased it could benefit you in the long run coming to your question to get started you need to find a good and genuine cloud mining provider and here are the list As a bonus gift…. 
- - Why dont more stores from all around the world start accepting bitcoin/ethereum?
  - Ya know Ive been thinking about that a good bit. While I wont claim to have a definitive answer as I dont know here are two thoughts I have. 
- - Can I transfer my Ethereum purchased from cex.io to Zebpay? Also, how can I withdraw Ethereum from cex.io to my Indian account?
  - Hope this helps. No, you can not send yor Ethereum to zebpay as they do not support Ethereum. Zebpay only deals in Bitcoin as of now. Or better would be to send the money to PayPal and then get directly in your account. I have helped a friend of mine from India purchase ethereum, his biggest concern was how could he sell ethereum again in return for rupees. 
- - What does it mean to formally verify the correctness of an Ethereum contract?
  - Think of this simply and it is easy to understand. Take the statement a + b = c. But executing this statement where for example a machine has run out of memory to hold some of the variables is not the concern of the proof, that is the concern of Software Testing. It basically just tells the world that the contract does what it should do according to the specification, nothing more nothing less. 
- - How do I invest in Ripple XRP without owning bitcoin or Ethereum? Since most of the apps, sites need either Bitcoin or Ethereum, which has to be converted to xrp.
  - Please note  do NOT attempt to purchase XRP, or any crypto, without first obtaining and properly setting up the appropriate wallet to hold it. You use a site that will change any coin to any coin like Changelly. Exchange cryptocurrencies at the best rate. or ShapeShift | Cryptocurrency Exchange | Simple Coin Conversion 
- - Ether is the fuel of the Ethereum blockchain. If I build my own token on it, separate from Ethereum, does this still drive up the ETH price?
  - Yes it does, though its indirect. Think of it like the relationship between Windows, the operating system and application developers for the PC. If I create an application for Windows and it does really well, people need to buy into Windows in order to use my software. Thats good for the underlying platform, though my application may have very little to do with the OS. As more Dapps get built for Ethereum, the successful ones will drive adoption for Ethereum because they need it for their apps. 
- - How would you explain the concept of a smart contract to someone who does not know much about blockchain/Ethereum?
  - Smart contracts Imagine that you own this magnificent apartment You’d like to rent it out, but unfortunately you’ll be moving to Brazil to learn salsa in a couple of weeks and you’re worried about nonpayment of rent. You can pay a lawyer to draft up a Rental Agreement, but as all aspiring landlords will know, a rental agreement is absolutely no guarantee that the tenant will not fly the coop. So instead, you and your tenant draft up a smart contract with the following clause 
- - Are any block chain companies hiring or is Ethereum too young for startups to be at that level?
  - There are plenty of Companies that are already working on Ethereum/Blockchain based products/services. Amongst many, Coinbase and is hiring. There are tons of companies that are currently working on Blockchain based technologies. If anything Blockchain isn’t young anymore, it is maturing aggressively and so is the market for it. Good Luck! All the Best! Blockchain startups are hiring. Good luck! 1. Go to Bitcoin, Ethereum and Blockchain events 
- - What are some good ideas for launching ICOs using ethereum tokens?
  - You can launch ICO for your project with Equity Tokens. 
- - Why does GDAX not charge fees for Ethereum trading?
  - Is there a BIDASK spread? And is it LARGE? I assume that they are “making the market”  buying low on the BID, selling HIGH on the ASK. And with the large spreads that are present, they probably use that to make enough and more money to provide the service they do. 
- - How is Ethereum related to apps? Will the value of Ether rise when a killer/popular app is born?
  - The EEA currently has hundreds of companies trying to develop apps that take advantages of the contracts solution on the Ethereum platform. Once a big company such as Intel or Microsoft comes up with a killer app say for distributed computing and the public hears that its based on Ethereum, the value of Ethers will explode. It is already exploding now since the asian/russian market is starting to pay attention to it. Imagine when it is main stream. 
- - Can I mine Ethereum using an Intel HD 2000 GPU?
  - For you to understand, Ethereum miners set computers loose to solve cryptographic puzzles in an attempt to win ether, and they need to try a huge number of computational problems until one unlocks a new batch of the asset. One of the interesting things about open blockchains is that, in theory, anyone can set their computers to focus on these cryptographic puzzles as a way to win rewards. 
- - What are the best resources to learn about ethereum?
  - All other answers have already good resources, I am adding one more resource. We curate best solidity tutorial and stories from all over the medium. 
- - What are the top ten exchange services for crypto currencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum?
  - If you mean “top 10 for me”, that is much more difficult. It has to do with your answers to the following questions. Is it important for you that your exchange accepts deposits of cryptocurrencies? Yes/No If you currently have cryptocurrencies and just want to change your exchange, the new exchange must accept deposits of cryptocurrencies. Some exchanges only do Fiattocrypto and those exchanges are then not available to you. 
- - How do I buy Ethereum from my Coinbase account?
  - You can easily begin trading on GDAX previously known as Coinbase Exchange by completing a few steps. It’s quite simple! Global Digital Asset Exchange  GDAX You may have to move funds over to the exchange first before buying but this is the coinbase option to purchase Ethereum. 
- - What does POS mean for Ethereum mining, and if I build a mining rig, how will it affect me?
  - A2A. Proof of Stake essentially means, the probability for a node to mine a transaction block is directly proportional to the ‘Stake’ the node e.g. amount of Ether it previously mined has in the network. 
- - Why is there an Ethereum hashrate drop in graphics cards?
  - It doesn’t . Under normal operation , the gpu will produce the same hashrate , regardless of age . As more people mine and as computing power increases because of hardware improvement, difficulty will increase. It takes more time to mine the same amount of ethereum. Therefore the hashrate drops. This is perfectly normal and happens with all coins. 
- - What is the best and most efficient way to learn Solidity Ethereum Smart Contract Programming Language?
  - Being a very new programming language it is hard to find resources but Solidity is similar to JavaScript. I would start with the official documentation of Solidity [1]. Followed by trying some cool stuff and later moving to bigger projects. While searching online I came across few basic tutorials on it as well [2] [4] and a course online buy Udemy [3]. Hope that helps. Why? Read on.. How can I start with Blockchain development? 
- - Do all applications on Ethereum share the same Blockchain transaction history?
  - Yes. For example ERC  20 token REDL 2,750,000 tokens or REDLs go on sale Fabruary 14th, 2018. In general 15,937,500 RL tokens or REDLs of ERC20 standard will be issued. 80% or 12, 875, 000 out of them will be available for crowdsale. The calculated value of 1 REDL = 1 USD. The amount of the bonus when buying a REDL token during crowdsale will depend on the number of REDL tokens already sold 
- - What are the first steps someone should take when considering their first investment in digital currency Litecoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.?
  - Before you start getting everything set up to actually purchase crypto you should do a little okay a sht ton of research. Here is everything I wish someone told me when I started.

Accept the fact that you know nothing. 
- - How can I start using bitcoin and ethereum in my business?
  - It’s easy. I was able to convince a friend to implement Bitcoin payments at his company and watched as his I.T. guy implemented it. What I liked about it was the way one could take all sales in bitcoin and deposit into your Bitcoin wallet or only a percentage of the sale and have the remainder deposited into your bank account. 
- - Are Ethereum contracts legal contracts?
  - Any contract is legal as long as the terms of the contract don’t violate the law. For example, a contract that says “I will wash your car every day for $300 a month” is legal because both the activities in the contract i.e are legal. In another example, a contract that says “I will kill this person for $50,000” is illegal because killing is illegal. Such a contract cannot be enforced by the courts, if one of the parties violate the terms of this contract. 
- - Why will cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum appreciate?
  - It depends on the sort of problems that the blockchain solves. For eg, 
- - Can you make 21 million mining ethereum?
  - Technically, yes. You “mine” Ethereum by running DApps, or Distributed Applications. If you take the amount of ether you earn  computational cost, then you will have a net positive. However, this could take an extremely long time to reach such a high amount of money. Keep in mind as well that Ether’s value is in constant flux especially in the early stages. 
- - Is a Ethereum Solidity program itself stored on the blockchain?
  - Solidity is just a programming language for Ethereum applications which are badixally smartcontracts built on Etheteums network. Yes. That’s basically why you have one chance to get it right. 
- - Where should I invest my money to get at least double in about 4-5 months Bitcoin or Ethereum?
  - When you want to double your money, you have to keep in mind the current coin value. Bitcoin is at 8200$ and to double the investment it needs to be at 16400$. The higher the coin is priced, the tougher the chances for 2x gain in ‘short term’. It is certainly possible in long term. Same the case with Ethereum at it is priced at 370$. 
- - What is everything I should know about Ethereum for trading and buying as well as knowing about it in general?
  - Maybe it is not a basic knowledge but I hope this blog post will be handy Ethereum Everything you want to know about the Gas If you do believe this asset will go up in price the tactic should be simple!

I like to watch ameer rosnic YouTube videos myself… they are super informative 
- - How are Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange rates projected to grow exponentially up and not the other way round?
  - Back then, the security for cryptocurrency markets and exchanges had loopholes and lapses which were regularly exploited. Fast forward till today, ever since the launch of Ethereum and Alt coins, cryptocurrencies has been gaining traction. 
- - Is there any difference between Ethereum and Ether?
  - To answer it very simple, Consider ethereum as a currency and ether as USD. Ethereum is a blockchain protocol where ether is the unit used to measure ethereum. Ether is a piece of code that can be used to pay for the computational resources needed to run an application. 
- - What are some cryptocurrencies that have potential to aggressively increase in value soon, kind of like Ethereum?
  - Storj coin might be a good long term STORJ only because the underlying product has a real world use case storing data. I would go with coins providing specific vertical cloud services such as storage or computation on top of Ethereum or not. The name of the coin game these days is bringing cloud services ran by private companies onto public blockchain infrastructure. 
- - Should I change my Bitcoins to Ethereum?
  - Ether based on the Ethereum blockchain is a much more developer friendly environment allowing for the addition of Smart Contracts small programs and Dapps Decentralized apps and this is what is pushing the price of Ether higher. It is being adopted by many companies to develop products and services that are not supported by the Bitcoin blockchain They just released an alpha based testnet for development but it is a couple years from being mature. This adoption in the crypto development community of the Ethereum blockchain, IMO, will continue to push the price of Ether higher,while I believe transaction speed and price per transaction is hurting Bitcoin. I have no real preference one way or the other as a pure crypto but I see the most growth occurring in the ethereum based space especially as more and more of these Ethereum based projects come to fruition proving the Ethereum blockchain model. Bitcoin has some hurdles to overcome I think. 
- - What are the consequences of an Ethereum price increase if I have altcoins that can only be traded with Ethereum?
  - It increases the buying power of ETH, so if you have some you can now buy more of the altcoins you like. On the other hand of course, it reduces the relative value of your altcoins, should you wish to sell any back into Ether. Hypothetical Example 1 ETH is valued at $100 today. I can buy 10 units of Cardano ADA, which is valued at $1. Tomorrow, 1 ETH goes up to $200. Assuming the price of ADA is the same as yesterday, I could now get 20 units instead of 10 $100/$10 = 10; $200/$10 = 20. 
- - In Ethereum mining, where does the free money come from?
  - Visa and Mastercard get paid every transaction you make for validating it checking if the transaction comes from a card that has a certain amount of money to another valid account. They also make sure that the transaction is secure, unique, and nobody’s hampering with your card or their servers. They get paid for that service. 
- - Will Ethereum and Litecoin give a good return in 2018 if I invest now?
  - Ethereum, worth far less than Bitcoin at the moment but still moving, has been, as of late, showing off its claim to fame in the crypto world, leading some people to question whether 2018 might be the year of Ethereum. I think 2018 will be the year for Ethereum. Live Ethereum ETH price, market cap, historical prices, reviews Apart from that Litecoin is currently at approx. USD 250, it should give good returns in next one year. 
- - How will the price of Ethereum be impacted as companies adopt the Ethereum smart contract platform?
  - If companies develop dapps on ethereum platform it will drive ether price high.Nowadays there are lots of blockchain platform which are more advanced than ethereum.I believe ethereum needs to solve scalability issue.Icon icx has lots of chaces to become best blockchain platform as developer can build block chain on icons blockchain.With solid team and south Korea govt funding icon is best blockchain platform as of now . Icon can also support interoperability of blockchain . Many blockchain can communicate using icon platform. 
- - What do you think about crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum?
  - Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Goldcoin are the latest and greatest forms of currency. They will eventually become the worlds new money. Before the internet, the public was limited in the number of places it could go for information. We had public schools, public libraries, television, and magazines. Before Nakamoto invented bitcoin, these same people were restricted to using fiat currencies, currencies that could be massively inflated at the whim of their issuing authority.

- - How low can we expect Ethereum to go in the short-term?
  - It would appear the Market barometer is whatever BTC does the other currencies mirror and most price movements are directed by that contiguity, the main differential is down to specific developments in relation to the coin itself and having your finger on the pulse to keep in touch with such events will be a requirement in order to track it’s direction. Other than that you are keeping an eye on the Technicals for taking your view of the Market. 
- - I am considering learning all about Ethereum. Will going to the up-and-coming Devcon2 the best and the fastest way to learn Ethereum?
  - We curate best Blockchain tutorial and stories from all over the medium. Going to DevCon2 is definately a good idea.

They are also planning on many new financial instruments based on cryptocurrencies and decentralisation. 
- - Why is Ethereum making such drastic changes?
  - If you’re referring to the hardforking that’ll change it from POW to POS, that’s a good move. Its now deemed that mining is just such an inefficient use of power and and time. Almost all new coins are based on some kind of POS system instead. 
- - Is Ethereum facing a temporary dip or a permanent sharp dip?
  - Temporary dip along with the rest of the market. I think all the ICO interference SEC and China is a great thing for Ethereum. Once the amount of ICOs decreases, it means a lot less mass selling of ETH to raise funds. Plus their new upcoming implementation addresses some weaknesses that should help the platform. 
- - Why is Ethereum not based on Bitcoin?
  - Ethereum is a smart contract platform which can be used for currency transactions. Bitcoin is a digital currency which has basic support for stateless contract scripts.

Everybody who is able to provide the needed parameters hash of public key, signature of code is allowed to access them. 
- - Can a cryptocurrency token be on both NEO and Ethereum blockchains at the same time, and if so, why?
  - Because token creators decided so. The blockchain is a platform that serves the token transactions. Idon’t know if they can move them across blockchains, but they don’t want to take the risk of a blockchain failure. No! Why? Because the supply of a token refers to its creation. You can’t multiply anything without attracting attention. The idea of blockchain is to prevent such scenarios  Hope this helps, Cheers Roman.

- - Is Ethereum EIP legal?
  - The EIP simply puts forward an amendment to the Etherium Blockchain protocol that restores funds to their relevant addresses in cases of loss through hacking or otherwise. The adoption of this document threatens corruption and arbitrariness on the part of the developer and editors who make the decision. It’s my opinion 
- - What are some of your strategies when investing in Ethereum thatll work if I only put in $10 for a start?
  - Its very simple Dont do daily trading trying to increase your amount of ETH. Its a trap, 99% are losing at it, only the whales which control the market are making money on that. Trying to catch the upswings and downswings are like trying to catch a falling knife you may succeed once, but most of the times youll get nasty cuts. Take it from someone whos done it, and has been through it DONT 
- - Which phone apps are best for mining Ethereum and Bitcoins?
  - Currently, the coin that is minable by mobile is Electroneum ETN I was trading it on Cryptopia before I knew what it was. From my point of view, this coin has had significant volume in the past month which leads me to believe that ETN might be worth more than its current rate 0.00000730 BTC 0.08$ I’ve monitored it’s progress on social media and it has outranked Litecoin in terms of public interest. To me—this is a big deal. 
- - Should I buy Ethereum? Will I gain any profit, or should I go for Bitcoin?
  - BTC is at an historical $300B market cap. Its insane to see how far the cryptocurrencies market has come. I remember trading BTC at $400 last year... and here we are now. The crypto world is definitely getting the mainstream exposure and coverage it deserves, and this can also be seen on other big coins such as LTC, XRP, ETH, and also on altcoins.

- - Is now a good time to buy Ethereum or is it going to fall down?
  - If you’re very young, you might never have seen the things in the image below. These are paper checks. Their purpose was to make payments from one person to another person remotely. They could be mailed anywhere in the world and cashed. They were a previous generation’s version of Bitcoin or Ethereum. However the checks themselves were cheap and worthless, just slips of paper with account numbers on them. They didn’t become valuable until they were filled out, signed and verified. Think of Ethereum and Bitcoin as being electronic versions of these checks. They are worthless, yet they might be useful for helping to transport value. I would rather invest in a company that will use Ethereum transaction technology than buy the worthless Ethereum coins themselves. If however you want to invest in blank slips of paper, well, go ahead but I want no part of it. 
- - What is the best ethereum wallet generator?
  - Curious about this as well. So far, I have only used EXODUS Wallet to store my ETH and they work pretty decent. Looking forward to the answers.

  - In 2017 may, bitcoin price was 2000 usd , and now the price moved to 6000,according to me from the past 6 years its doing good. But the persons invested in it are scared when the price started decreasing. From my side its a bubble it can rise and fall with a very high amounts. But if u see for long term it is a good investment. I think the price of bitcoin in 2018 range will be 2500usd min, max point 15000usd. And the price of ethereum will be 1500usd before 2018, now it is 300usd .

- - Is Ethereums success dependent on Bitcoin?
  - No. That being said, of course the volatility of Bitcoin will affect Ethereum. It will affect all cryptocurrencies. When the granpa of cryptocurrencies, i.e. Bitcoin gets a hiccup, all cryptocurrencies get shaken up. However, that doesn’t mean that these cryptocurrencies will be under the shadow of Bitcoin for long. They have immense potential; each on their own. And Ethereum certainly looks one of the most promising ones. 
- - If Ethereum is currently rising in price, does it mean Bitcoin will then rise in price as well in regards to the latest price trend?
  - I think the relationship is actually reversed When Bitcoin rises in prices, it usually means that the altcurrencies Ethereum, Ripple, Monero, etc. will then start to increase in price following the price jump. Last month, Bitcoin went on a bull run, where it far outpaced every other currency as a percent of gain. However, as soon as BTC settled, almost every other top 20 currency jumped in price over the course of a two week period.

It’s amazing! Top Bitcoin Exchange List  CryptoCoinsMania.com Cryptocurrency Trading The List of Top Trading Sites 
- - Now that IOTA was flooded with money from Bosch RBVC, are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and other blockchain based cryptocurrencies going to burst?
  - Now that IOTA was flooded with money from Bosch RBVC, are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and other blockchain based cryptocurrencies going to burst? Dude.. WTF Apart from the fact that the amount which the RBVC fund has invested is not disclosed, i.e. it could be anywhere from $100k to $1B Apart from the fact that, I presume OP doesn’t know how Venture Capital work, let alone how an ICO and tokens work… And I hope you’ll correct me in the comments of the answer. 
- - Is coinzs ethereum wallet a scam?
  - Coinzs is a fairly new company in the cryptospace, they started in 2016. They have an Ethereum wallet, which I have not used yet as I am not a user of this site, but if you trust it, you can use it to store your ethers and hopefully, other ERC20 Tokens as well. There are some good feedbacks about it so maybe I would give it a try sometime later. 
- - Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurriencies reached new highs in August 2017 but are now falling sharply beginning in September. What caused the trend to change and how long will it last?
  - 2 different things happened in the last few days. The same was true at $1k and it will probably again be true at $10k As for why all coins are affected, in my humble yet correct opinion, all alt coins are affected by bitcoin’s price. Once they fall, people are practically forced to cash out into what  Bitcoin. They don’t have another choice. Seeing bitcoin was also dropping the logical decision for the masses after cashing out into BTC was to cash out into fiat until the dust settled.

- - What are the best platforms for automatically accumulating ethereum, say a $100,000 position accumulated over a consolidation period?
  - Nothing is going to automatically accumulate anything for you without knowing what price points you want to buy in/sell out at and how hard when it does. The difficulty in setting up trade bots/automated arbitrage/options and futures accounts, the “automatic” money making mechanisms, even if you have money to burn, is the selection of the variables and triggers that are required to tell the automation tools what to do. They cant make up what levels of risk you are comfortable with, and if someone put out an “auto” tool like that commercially.. Im not even sure its even legal. That might fall under Ponzi definitions by default. Not to mention the fact that letting a computer run a macro trading live money for you while not knowing all the ins and outs of what its actually doing is akin to playing Russian roulette with all but one cylinder filled, not the other way around. Ask Wall St. Youre basically doing no better than a casino at that point statistically since youre not going to have the ability to manipulate the variables based on news/real world data/changes and they cant be “auto” ingested by your initial algorithm. You will be hoping for luck at each manipulation point, and luck is not a grest investment basis. Might as well take that $100k and play some slots. 
- - What may be consequences as Jio is selling Jiocoin for Bitcoin and Ethereum?
  - When Bitcoin was first invented, it was a great innovation with a lot of practical world application. But the popularity it gained recently is like no time before. Investment in cryptocurrencies went alltime high, and with that, the prices also skyrocketed. The expected high return rate attracts a huge number of people to invest in cryptocurrencies. As more and more new cryptocurrencies are starting, there is much anticipation about the Jio Coin.

- - What are some early stage alternatives to Bitcoin and Ethereum that have scope for similar levels of growth and why?
  - I believe the Cosmos team has what it takes to create a viable infrastructure blockchain. Their product, Tendermint, has already shown to be a promising product, tackling the blockchain technology problem in a different way. Note I am not invested in Cosmos, I just happen to be a huge fan. If you consider the fact that ethereum went live on 30 July 2015, it’s pretty early stage. It’s just 22 months old. It’s not even 2 years. It’s definitely at it’s early stage. “Metropolis” is yet to roll out.. 
- - What is the cost of Ethereum now?
  - Best Regards! If you need a help with cryptocurrencies or something other, you can contact with me on my website in my bio 
- - Should I invest everything in Bitcoin and Ethereum? What are your most compelling reasons for or against it?
  - But that leads to the main point against going all in on BTC and ETH. The crypto market is incredibly volatile, your entire savings could disappear or lose half its value in a day. When moments of large uncertainty appear on the cryptocurrency market, you must prepare yourself not to be rash and sell immaturely. Governments could all of a sudden decide to enact harsh policies against crypto holding and cause panic on the market cryptocurrency makes tax evasion much harder to combat. 
- - With Ethereum ETH mining difficulty rising rapidly, does it make sense to switch to mining Ethereum Classic ETC right away or should we wait?
  - I was a miner made $50,000 in the starting of 2017 but due to certain i closed it. So I think I can give you the perfect answer to this question. I should say if you have less budget and cant buy more rigs you should switch to ETC. Yes the only reason is the rapid increase in difficulty. Time by time the difficulty will increase.. So this is right time to take an action 
- - Who is doing growth for Ethereum?
  - Being able to execute its vision of building a true blockchain platform to build commercially viable technology applications. You can read more about it at a similar question. What drove the price of Ethereum up? 
- - Whats the simplest, cheapest way to liquidate over $1M worth of Ethereum cryptocurrency ETH?
  - Probably going over the counter and contact a trading desk. If you liquidate this on the open market you will be the fat kid jumping into the swimming pool that I talked about in my answer to this question Chris Stewarts answer to How long will it take for Bitcoin to become a stable currency? When you say ‘liquidate’, my assumption is that you want to move from Ethereum to Fiat, with as few interactions as possible. 
- - How could the Bitcoin value crash affect the value of Ethereum?
  - Well as you can see, the whole market is so small that everything is connected. People investing are selling everything when they feel a market crash or correction is incoming, like I did Sunday. The market has grown from 12 billion to 340 billion on Wednesday. But this is still very low as I said. When the market gets to 4 trillion, and the coins begin to have real world usage or apps, then the two will be separated. 
- - Where can I find answers to questions about Bitcoin and Ethereum, based on real-time market analysis? Which cryptocurrency is worth it?
  - For now here is all you need to know. BTC is KING of crypto currencies. ETH is KING of the BLockchain world that is fast approaching. blockchain technology coming is like trying to imagine Google and Facebook on the day the first web browser came out, that is how far we are out. But its coming. I liken this bitcoin craze, which mellenials are slowly talking about bitcoin as like digital gold ETH based on blockchain technology will change the world. 
- - How will gambling services improve in Ethereum apps?
  - The online gambling industry can benefit from Blockchain and Ethereums smart contract in many different ways. 
- - Can Bitcoin be upgraded to do things that Ethereum can, like with smart contracts etc?
  - Probably not, as this is a fundamental feature. However, you don’t need to extend the actual Bitcoin, features can be added as second layer on top of bitcoin. For example the Lighting Network and Root Stock can function on top of bitcoin  adding the new functionality but using bitcoin at the core. Both Root stock and Lighting Network can allow higher scaling and smart contracts using Bitcoin as underlying token. 
- - Will people use Cardano instead of Ethereum?
  - Yes in future people start using it when they will get to know about its very big advantage infront of Ethereum it will have The only one great advantage is that Cardano can be used as transaction coin and everything will be smooth and fast whereas Ethereum could not hold up transactions faster. That’s it If u want more info, then click on below name to follow and see the magic.. Rudraksh Kapoor 
- - Which is the best way to buy Ethereum in India, through direct currency Koinex or through Bitcoin Zebpay?
  - I have been trading for sometime now, and I have been using koinex for almost 2 months. I would like to state that you can directly buy Ether through koinex. A major difference between koinex and zebpay is that the former is a trading platform where orders and bids get executed as per the bids of sellers there. Zebpay is a broker and thats why Zebpays buy/sell spread is always high… 
- - Could Ethereum go down after touching $400 in June 2017?
  - It’s already down my friend. It’s down back to 135$. Cryptocurrencies are falling now simply because, fundamentally, the selling pressure is greater than the buying PRESSURE. IT is part of the natural cycle of each market, whether they be currency pairs or stocks or commodities or cryptocurrencies, when selling audience is increase…it’s always down the market. Watch below video to understand why it’s falling. 
- - Will Ethereum surpass Bitcoin? If so, how long would it take? Should I purchase it now for the future?
  - These are very speculative questions. It is impossible to say for sure what will happen. It is possible only to guess. Especially that the current crypto currency market is in a growing bubble. Best advice I could share is repeat Jason Lim comment. Invest in both and try few other not so popular currencies. Check the data see if they have created something or just raising money. And of course invest only as much as you are willing to lose. 
- - Is it a good idea to invest €100 in ethereum right now?
  - If you’re a long term investor Yes, it’s a good time to buy Ethereum. If you’re a short term investor/swing trader you might want to wait a little bit. If you’re a bargain hunter, consider transferring some money into an exchange and waiting for a dip in price before entering to limit your downside risk although minimally. This advice comes from somewhere close to my heart. Ethereum was the first coin I ever bought. 
- - How did Vitalik Buterin come up with the idea for Ethereum?
  - Vitalik pondered turing completenes based on MasterCoin now Omni in November 2013 [17.11.13 011120] vbuterins but hmm, the algorithm on the block chain I pondered about the question myself. Assumed it was the influence of his father and his experience with Bitcoin. You can hear it in the below video from the ‘boy’ himself ! Vitalik on his Ethereum Journey Influence  Dmitrybuterinfatherinfluencer 
- - Is it good to invest in ethereum in the website ethx.in?
  - At this time, specially when the government has confirmed, they will not support any electronic currency crypto currency, as per our government the crypto currency is not legal to deal/tread with this. Now come to your question, Dost, we cannot comment on this question as the website “ethx.in” you mentioned is new and this is not popular as well. Would recommend you to please use platform or exchange which is popular and trustworthy. 
- - What currency should I invest between the NEO and Ethereum?
  - I would invest in NEO for two reasons,firstly Neo is more advanced in terms of code. Secondly, Neo will not be charging extrotianate fees in the future, like the founder of Ethereum plans to action. I have to buy any new Cryptocurrency with Ethereum and sometimes the fees cost me more than Bitcoin fees to transfer! Neo is a solid cryptocurrency that is Chinas national crypto and is an infastructure crypto, so new cryptocurrencies can be based off the advancements of NEO! 
- - How could ethereum be improved?
  - There are a few problems with ethereum. At present probably the key issue with it is its usability and simple user interfaces. There need to be more wallets that are user friendly and there needs to be better education on what ethereum is  i.e. what can be built with ethereum. 
- - How can I buy Ethereum? Is there any app like there is Zebpay for bitcoins?
  - You can also buy it from an Indian exchange, but they keep going off and on. You need to do your KYC documents verification, link your bank account and buy ethereum with INR. The process takes some time. But at present this is the best way to buy ethereum in India Koinex. After buying it, transfer the ether to myetherwallet address. Access myetherwallet through ledger nano or trezor. 
- - What is the use of a private blockchain Hyperledger or Ethereum when distributed databases and web services to exchange info are already present?
  - Blockchains were not created to replace web services or distributed databases. In a lot of ways, Ethereum and Bitcoin are terrible for exchanging information because of the expense. 
- - Looking at the state of Bitcoins now, what will the state of Ethereum after 1-2 years?
  - A very valid point of view!!! If bitcoin has gained so much then it is a collateral upside that ethereum will see in a span of 1–2 years. those who are new to cryptos will want to buy bitcoin but as the price has increased sharply it is getting out of reach of a common man to buy one full coin. So eventually people will buy ether which is at the second spot after bitcoin and the price will see a sharp increase soon.

  - I have designed my solution to be resistent to fluctuations in valuation and as such, it will end speculation and mining.

There are certain factors that you should make sure are right, which will eventually lead to better mining and will benefit you in the long run. If you want to know how much you can make mining Etherum, read the following article. Tips for better mining 
- - Why most of the websites support only Bitcoin and Ethereum trading and not other cryptocurrqncies?
  - Bitcoin is the master of crypto 1.0 Ethereum is at the moment the ruler of crypto 2.0 This is how the market sees these two coins and believe they are here to stay. As the result they both are valuated so high and accepted and offered by every prominent exchange. There are, however, enough exchanges who are mostly focused on providing wide range of any possible coins. I think this is just the way how the “cryptoperators” position themself. 
- - Should I buy $4000 of Ethereum right now and sell it in 1 week? Its a gamble but those are the conditions.
  - You should not just buy Ethereum randomly. I think that Ether will go to around $500 by the end of the year. The price of Ethereum changes daily up to 20%40% so in order to get your best return you will need to buy when it is in a period of being low, or cheap. 
- - Why are there so many attacks on ethereum?
  - There were similar attacks on Bitcoin during its growth phase. So, you can call it growth pain. It is indeed pain for many devs and enthusiasts of the Ethereum platform. However, people mostly accept the situation and work through on it. Generally and longterm, it is good. The platform gets closer and closer to the real life needs and demands. 
- - Is it possible to buy bitcoin and Ethereum in the United States as an international student?
  - Man , use your native countrys ID for verification later you can use any payment Methods of your choice.

When you have Bitcoins you can buy any other Crypto Currency. 
- - Is the difficulty in mining Ethereum starting to stabilise or will it continue to increase at the same rate?
  - The short answer is it will continue to increase, but there are a lot of factors to consider. Supply and Demand Different coins have different difficulty schemas. Some coins are purely based on supply and demand how many transaction are there vs how many miners are there. In other words, the more people use it, the greater the need for miners. On the flip side, the more miners, the lower the reward. Planned Difficulty and PoS Price 
- - What do financial advisors say to their clients about investing in Bitcoin/Ethereum?
  - High risk, but very very high rewards. I have seen a few places saying there is no hurt in adding 3% of your net worth in either of these…. But this is not investment advice, do your own research and get your own financial advice from an expert. In the US, financial advisors are licensed and regulated. Since cryptocurreny is not yet “accepted” by regulators, most advisors wont advise u to invest. 
- - Is there any blockchain thats trying to combine Ethereum and Monero where smart contracts execute privately?
  - Yes, Ethereum. But not with Monero, they’re trying to combine their tech with Zcash. The Zcash devs even get invited to Ethereum conferences and such, exactly to talk about the problem you mention. 
- - Can Ethereum reach above 2,000 US by mid-2018?
  - Best Cryptocurrency in 2018 We can never predict what price Ethereum will reach. But it’s definite that it is rising steadily and will be one of the most profitable cryptocurrency across the globe. Investing or trading using Ethereum is very beneficial, because Ethereum will never come to an end. It is a technology which has changed the information technology industry vastly. 
- - Where can I download Claymore Mining for Ethereum mining?
  - Build software better, together Cheers 
- - Can I set up an IRA that would allow me to invest in Ethereum?
  - Yes, here are two methods to use Some of the primary benefits with this method are The fundamental principal behind cryptocurrency is to serve as a peertopeer, digital currency on a free global market. As the saying goes don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater. You can absolutely set up an Ethereum based selfdirected IRA. There are two ways you can go about it. 
- - Has Ethereum or Stellar gained steam with the recent Bitcoin issues of 2015-2016?
  - The sad thing is, there is some good news supporting this general price pump and there will be more good news from a lot of Ethereum based startups in the next few months. Its been close to 6 months since the project lunched and most of the companies that have started working with it around that point will soon have announcements on their progress and their products. 
- - Is it the right time to invest in Ethereum at 237 dollars? What can be the possible target within a year or two?
  - If you’re playing the long game and will hold at least for another year or two, buying now or tomorrow or even next week is fine. These +20 dollar swings won’t matter because in 2 years Ethereum can be at $1000 dollars. Ethereum seems to have a brighter future than Bitcoin due to its faster transaction times, its ability to do contracts and its ability to do distributed computing. If the blockchain is adopted into cloud based products in the future, it will be huge. 
- - Do you really believe Ethereum is the perfect competitor of Bitcoin, or is it just peoples worship?
  - Long Answer Generally in Internet or Software domain, we have seen highly unrelated products turning out to be competitors. The answer to the question needs to be seen from two angles It is an interesting question and like everyone else I am eager to observe how the rivalry would unfold over time. 
- - What if Facebook, AWS, and Google diverted their computing power to mining for Bitcoin or Ethereum for 1 day, would it be worth it for them?
  - Those companies currently have valuations more than 10 times what bitcoin is. Their whole company would shut down if they turned off their servers, so no. That would be insane. Even a moment of downtime can be incredibly damaging, both to users, and to the reputation of the service. It’s not even close. The reward from mining is a just a tiny percentage of the total coins already existing, and the total coins existing are only a fraction of what those companies are worth. 
- - If Ethereum blockchain uses GPUs to solve the math problems, how is this done in PoS?
  - With POS there is no mining, you simply hold the dedicated amount of coins and you collect a % stake at the end of the year. 
- - Which is cheaper compared to 1 USD Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum?
  - In my opinion, most likely BTC. I say this because of the potential it still has to grow. Compared to the USD, it is likely that it is close to its lowest pointbetween now and the future. Bulls are saying BTC could reach as high as $1Million per coin on the high end and $50K on the low end. Bears have said Bitcoin is dead over 200 times since 2009 and will probably continue to do so if it keeps climbing and correcting. Its a tough question to answer without bias. I own BTC. Hope this helped. 
- - How does the value of all of the ERC20 tokens in circulation influence the total value of the Ethereum economy? Do they still count towards the volume of Ethereum somehow?
  - In a way, yes. You used a good term ‘economy’, I’d extend that to ecosystem developers, users, investors etc.. More ERC20 tokens mean more developers and users, which provide stability and a positive growth outlook. Hence an increasing ETH economy. Not directly, no. However, its still a good thing for Ethereum. Lets take an example from the smart phone race to illustrate this. 
- - Why is Ethereum going down today 06/12/2017?
  - Ethereum is slow to grow since it hit 400$ in june. It had a growth of over 50 times in 6 month, Ethereum is resting since then. There is too much action going on Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, now IOTA, and others. 
- - In the event of a huge stock market crash, what would likely happen to Bitcoin, Ethereum and other alt coins?
  - Nothing, they aren’t related to stocks or fiat currency in anyway. The economic crisis of 2008 was the catalyst for the creation of Bitcoin and the reason why it became so popular in the first place. As you can see there is no real correlation between stocks SandP 500 and Bitcoin. the NORTH KOREA crisis a week or so was enough for me. BITCOIN is now seen as a safe haven or shelter for money in times of crisis or economic meltdowns. 
- - Is it profitable to exchange Bitcoins to Ethereum?
  - For both long term and short term perspective Bitcoin is much better than Ethereum. Ethereum is much more better than Bitcoin due to its business model , use case, uniqueness . If it is first in the crypto market like Bitcoin ,you can’t imagine the price of ETH now . In case of long term invest Ethereum is better .In future its like mini blockchain on a blockchain platform. In case of exchange commission or miner feeIt takes more BTC for Exchange. 
- - Why is Ethereum better than Ripple, if indeed the case?
  - I don’t think you can call one “better” than the other since they’re working towards different goals. Ethereum and Ripple are quite different. Ripple is designed with international transfers in mind. Ethereum is designed to be an uncensorable general purpose computer. In theory, you could build Ripple on Ethereum but not the other way around. 
- - Can people invested in Tezos hire hackers to hack in the Ethereum blockchain to speed up corporate adoption of Tezos?
  - No. Sorry to say this, although your question is quite valid, but I think you’re delusional, time to wake up. ETH is at #2 position for a reason. Do you really think the people working for the Ethereum project are that stupid and will let something like this happen so easily? You are on forums way too much for your own good. Time to step into the real world and stop the conspiracy theories. 
- - Which is the best place to invest in Ethereum? Is it too late?
  - I have to ask.. why Ethereum? Is it because of the returns they’ve experienced lately? Is it because you don’t want to jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon? Or is it because you truly believe in the underlying technology that Ethereum deploys? 
- - Ethereum prices are dropping like crazy. Should I sell all my eth now or should I wait till it raises back?
  - Judging by the notsovast history of the crypto market, it seems right for me to dissuade you from going ahead and selling your Ether. After all, the market has suffered such shocks in the past, only for it to recover and become bearish yet again. So, provided you have the patience to buy and hold, I’d recommend you NOT to sell your Ether. Need further convincing? Scroll down. 
- - Can public blockchain Ethereum be used to remove tracker-server from BitTorrent protocol?
  - It’s theoretically possible, though I think tracker servers will still be an significant part of the BitTorrent universe. Here’s why 
- - Why is Ethereum the only coin that goes up when Bitcoin goes down?

- - Can I transfer my Ethereum from Coinbase wallet to Koinex wallet where it calls it Ether?
  - Yes, you can. However, ether and ethereum are not same and most people don’t care to know the difference too. There are 3 main differences between ether and ethereum. Many exchanges and people use ether and ethereum as interconvertible terms. So, when we talk about putting these in wallets or an exchange, ofcourse these are the same thing, in that context, in common tongue. Cheers. Yes ether and ethereum both are same 
- - Could Ethereum be used to cut out vendors?
  - Yes, specially for digital items. Example Imagine that you are a seller of Antivirus software. You sell codes that users need in order to activate their antivirus software for a certain amount of time. With Ethereum you could write a smart contract where if a payment of X.XX Ethereums or X.XX Bitcoins is made to an address, a code is activated or renewed for you or you can have the antivirus client scan the “paid list” before it downloads the latest updates or the latest virus database. 
- - How much Ethereum do you suggest buying?
  - It depends in your budget. Back in the bear market, I dropped $3k on ethereum when it was about $385/share. I remember how it peaked at $1000+ So I felt confident to buy enough to get a significant payout when the market rises. The best answer you will ever receive about investing is to never invest more than you are willing to lose. 
- - What did Ethereum founder, Vitalik Buterin, discuss with President Vladimir Putin, when they met at the International Economic Forum in June 2017?

But they will launch mobile app very soon. Buyucoin 
- - What is a safe desktop or mobile wallet for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoon?
  - You should keep BTC/Ether/LTC/other coins in wallets only if the investment is short term or you need it for daily trading. No Mobile wallet or exchange is safe to keep Bitcoins for long term, Since they are prone to hacking or loss of coins or government crackdown. You can store the coins in secure hardware devices which will be isolated and can be physically stored as per your choice and will be safe from even government crackdown on exchanges/wallets. 
- - Why would cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum skyrocket if we end up in a scenario where most of the big companies have built their own private blockchain?
  - I’m afraid there is a contradiction in terms here “private” and “blockchain” don’t mix easily.

- - Should I give up Bitcoin and focus on other crypto like Ripple, Ethereum and BCH?
  - Here are some notes from it 
- - What effect will Casper have on the price of Ethereum?
  - Original question ‘What effect will Casper have on the price of Ethereum?’ 
- - Why does the technology underlying ethereum make the currency itself valuable?
  - Ethereum is a platform that lets you build Decentralized apps Dapps that run smartcontracts on the blockchain. Since computers on a blockchain don’t have a physical location, there needs to be a mechanism to turn it off and keep its usage finite. Nodes running the blockchain or miners shouldn’t have to run useless contracts that don’t do anything and waste power. 
- - What are some thoughts of the Ethereum price fall?
  - Ethereum is a cryptocurrency and a payment system, just like the betterknown Bitcoin, but its also a decentralized platform that allows developers to build and run applications. Its currency, ETH or Ether, soared in value in the last six months or so, jumping from about $10 per ETH token to about $380 last week. But ETH is currently trading at about $233, according to Coindesk, losing about 20% of its value in the last 24 hours alone. 
- - How can I take my money from Ethereum Wallet?
  - Its not clear what you meant by your question. If you want to exchange your ether for fiat money, youll need to either transfer it to an exchange if its not at one already and sell it there, or sell it to someone else whos willing to pay you cash for it. If you mean how you can take some of your ether and transfer it to another wallet yours or someone elses, do a Google search for how to transfer ether from your particular wallet where your ether is stored. Hi, 
- - How do I receive ERC20 tokens from an ICO on my Ledger Nano? Does it have to be an Ethereum wallet which is able to receive the tokens, or can I just give the address of my Ledger Ethereum wallet?
  - I wouldn’t reccomend using a Ledger Nano S or Blue for an ICO. It’s better to use a MEW instead. MEW private keys can printed and stored offline, but for ICO generally you need to send it to a smart contract, so you’ll need internet. Here are all the ERC 20 tokens supported by Ledger Blue or Nano S. The Nano S is a great hard wallet and the beauty is it will support MyEther Wallet. This in turn means you can store your ERC20 token keys on the Nano S walllet utilising the MyEther walllet. 
- - Why hasnt Bitcoin developed the platform similar to Ethereum?
  - Why Bitcoin Hasn’t Developed a Platform to Compete with Ethereum They’re two different entities, with different goals, and different product roadmaps. They will both go on their own paths to solve the problems they individually set out to solve. There are some coins that are competitors to each other, with over 1300 coins now there are bound to be repeats. What is Bitcoin? What is Ethereum? 
- - Whatre your opinions and thoughts on investing in Ethereum? Could its value increase, similarly to Bitcoin?
  - It’s Bitcoin 2.0. A better version with more possibilities than Bitcoin has right now. It’s value will increase, as it’s a cheaper, safer, decentralized and more efficient alternative to fiat currencies. It is inevitable that more fiat currencies’ value will flow to cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Gulden. 
- - Has the hack that caused the Ethereum hard fork been fixed in ETC?
  - The code of the DAO was hacked, not Ethereum. So the fix was to move the ETHs from hacker account to the original one. No, that wasnt done on ETC. The hacker eventually cashed out his coins. I didnt follow it too close if he moved everything and if ETC guys tried identify him. But that is different story. Basically ETC didnt care about the stolen the DAO funds so they didnt fix anything. 
- - How do I raise capital using ethereum tokens?
  - You may want to consider launching an idea for a functional “token.” Blockchain based startups are currently utilizing different forms of ICO’s Initial Coin Offerings to raise millions in donations to help further the technology behind projects. Most ICO’s look to accept donations in the form of Bitcoin or Ether, or both. The most reputable ones will have a published White Paper, along with a clear website and an experienced management team from the industry they want to innovate in. 
- - Is there any chance of increase to the Ethereum price from 2018?
  - I would say that prices are expected to drop. At the moment, a large number of weak hands have entered the cryptocurrency market. Weak hands tend to not know much about cryptocurrencies and be highly volatile while strong hands are able to sustain heavy losses. In recent months, the ratio between weak hands and strong hands has increased. Thus, the bubble explosion is becoming increasingly possible. This applies to every cryptocurrency. 
- - What is a DAG in Ethereum?
  - A directed acyclic graph. It means it’s a tree where a node has multiple parents. They’re the components to create the Dagger algorithm used in Ethereum. Basically they make Ethereum’s proof of work system more memoryhard which makes it ASICresistant. ASICs application specific integrated circuits are just special hardware that make it easier to mine bitcoin. It’s much harder to use ASICs in Ethereum, so the mining process is more democratic and keeps powers more decentralized. 
- - How can I exchange Bitcoin for Ethereum in the US?
  - The best way, in my opinion, is to transfer your Bitcoin to an online exchange that supports both Bitcoin and Ether. There, you can purchase ETH and possibly other currencies depending on your choice. Personally, I prefer Cryptopia and Bittrex, but I think Bittrex has closed registrations. Binance too. I do not recommend Coinbase due to their ongoing support of Roger and Bcash, their delayed withdrawals, and some of their terms.

  - Gas is the execution fee for every operation made on the ethereum protocol. Ether is used to purchase Gas, which is required to run smart contracts and submit transactions to Ethereum. Gas is the primary method through which miners processing smart contracts get paid. Each instruction sent to the Ethereum Virtual Machine to process a transaction or smart contract costs a specific amount of Gas. If the required amount of Gas is not provided to the transaction, it will fail before completion.

- - Do you think Ethereum will ever reach 12,000 dollars for one coin?
  - Yes and No. It can happen if Crypto gets major acceptance and A LOT OF money will go to Cryptocurrency and it will affect Ethereum.

These are my thoughts and analytics, Andrew  
- - Should I sell gold and buy Bitcoins and Ethereum instead for a long term investment?
  - I would consider crypto currencies to be a somewhat risky investment. There are no business assets to use for valuation purposes. In fact, the only value comes from what people are currently willing to pay. Although I can see the utility of an alternative currency, Bitcoin and the like are not being used for day to day transactions. The vast majority of the people who are putting their money in at this time, are doing so solely for a return on their investment. In my eyes, that is bad. If it is not being used for it’s intended purpose a way to give sound money back to the people, then we will continue to see these wild swings. Also, as you might have seen, the exit door is pretty narrow. Every one of these 20–30% down days has seen the exchanges temporarily go offline. I would hesitate to have my money in any investment that wasn’t instantly redeemable AT ANY TIME I CHOOSE.

  - 2 points Crpto is not a ‘get rich quick scheme’. All the best. do your own research. buy and forget about it, ie, don’t price watch. don’t panic and sell because there’s been a dip. Buy when there’s a dip.. buy more the bigger the dip. buy as soon as you can. Put it in your own secure wallet. Do not leave on an exchange wallet. 
- - What does Do not send ETH directly to an Ethereum contract mean on Coinbase? Is it the same as not sending it directly to a contract address?
  - Your coinbase wallet is not really ‘yours’ as you do not control the private keys .. you just trust them to do that. Send your ethereum from the coinbase wallet to your mew address 0x….. From there you can use the ETH to send to an ICO or any other smart contract Be very careful of Scams!!! Never give your private key to anyone, ever! Do your due diligence please. Be Lucky! No there’s a difference between a “smart contract” and an “Ethereum address”. 
- - Should I buy ethereum or bitcoin to see the greatest ROI in the distant future?
  - I’d suggest ethereum, because ethereum will have increased demand as there is more inherent utility Its like talking about Nokia vs IoS. Nokia allowed you to make only calls wheres IOS was a platform for different mobile applications. This is the same analogy with bitcoin and ether. Bitcoin allows you to only transfer a btc from one account to another, whereas ethereum blockchain is a platform for different Decentralised Applications 
- - After investing in cryptocurrencies and truly appreciating the value of blockchain technology, I am ready to make the leap to become personally involved in the development of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. What sources should I look for?
  - I think it depends in large part on your current technical skills. I would consider my answer relevant for someone who has a basic level of front end web development knowledge. A person who could effectively tweak a gorgeous wordpress theme but couldn’t create one. Implying a basic understanding of Javascript without having neccessarily mastered it. I.e. me. Let me explain.

Coinbase wallet is convenient though which makes it a good place to store small amount of ethereum that gets transacted frequently.

- - How are taxes handled in the U.S. when you sell over a million dollars worth of Ethereum?
  - The IRS issued guidance a couple of years ago that they view cryptocurrencies as property. As such, if you sell Ethereum at a profit  assuming you are not directly employed in the cryptocurrency business  you most likely have capital gain, which is taxed at ordinary income tax rates if you held it for less than one year. I assume that you sold for US dollars, which would clearly be a “sale or exchange” triggering this result. The result is less clear if you rolled your Ethereum into another coin, such as Bitcoin, in which case there could be the possibility of treating the transaction as a like kind exchange. It is an unsettled area of tax law. 
- - Should I buy Ethereum or Bitcoin with $4000? I currently have 35 ethers, 40 litecoins, and 1.02 bitcoins in my portfolio.
  - Personally, I prefer Bitcoin or Litecoin over Ethereum for the time being. Not that Ethereum will not outperform but it carries greater shortterm risk. The recent ICO ban in China is only the beginning. We will likely see other countries follow suit and clamp down on ICO and regulate them. This will have an adverse effect on Ethereum as one of it’s primarily use cases at the moment is launching ICOs.

  - We always recommend buying Bitcoin before going with altcoins. Ether may be considered Bitcoin 2.0 but we dont know whats ahead in terms of problems. 
- - How would you introduce Ethereum to somebody whose knowledge of cryptocurrencies is limited to a general idea of the bitcoin blockchain?
  - Easiest way I can think of to relate the two projects Bitcoin can be thought of like a ledger for the cryptocurrency BTC.

When Bitcoin was thought of, there was an idea that certain aspects of a cryptocurrency could be programmed to create ‘smart contracts’. While the developers of Bitcoin had an idea of what they wanted to do, they hadn’t figured out the exact implementation to make it work. 
- - Why would you want to do an ICO on NEO as opposed to Ethereum?
  - From a financial view  Neo has more growth potential than bitcoin, although riskier. Therefore an ICO on NEO could see double gains. Gains in the ICO tokens Neo value, added by an increase in value of Neo in terms of USD. I believe that if you are targeting a Chinaspecific market, NEO may confer an advantage because its a homegrown cryptocurrency. 
- - Will an Ethereum bubble burst also crash the price of Bitcoin?
  - Yes IF there is a Ethereum bubble. Ethereum’s marketcap is definitely big enough that if there was a bubble, it would have an effect on Bitcoin and the rest of the economy. It depends on why it bursts and how connected the uneducated masses think they are. There is some connection through ICOs but fundamentally one was designed to be an exchange medium and another was designed for a completely different functionsmart contracts. 
- - Should I transfer my Bitcoins to Coinbase or Cex.io, to convert to Ethereum? Which one would you suggest?

Think about the stockmarket after 11 september 2001 or 18 september 2008 there will be no demand and can all Icos fall. Even 0,00 is possible, because there no possessions. In a market in panic there are no investors, even not in Icos. If Icos dont change it is a hype and when i see the rate of Bitcoin it is only the question when the meltdown will start not if. 
- - When cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are hacked, whats the point? Doesnt everyone just watch to see what they spend it on?
  - The money cant be recovered, but exchanges can make it hard for hackers to move funds back to cash. So if funds are stolen, it would become very difficult to move it around without getting spotted. However, value is value. Even if its highly traceable cash, $30 million is still $30 million. 
- - Is Bitcoin a public blockchain versus Ethereum being a private blockchain?
  - No. A blockchain is a decentral database that stores transactions in the sense of a public ledger. That means everybody is invited to download and work with that information to proove that any transaction on it is mathematically valid. Bitcoin and Etherum are most well known services, that are using blockchain technology at this moment. If their service would not been public, we most probably would not even discuss about them. Indeed being public is a very key element to make sure, that transaction cannot be corrupted, because it would mean you have to join at least 50% of the whole networks computing power, and naturally all participants in a blockchain network use software that automatically helps to do the math that proove any transaction cannot have been corrupted. Be aware that a blockchain basically stores a bunch of numbers, the knowledge who is doing what using a blockchain, is a complete other story, that cannot be linked to the technology itself. 
- - What are the various proposals for scaling Ethereum, excluding forks?
  - Disclaimer I’m not an Ethereum expert. This is just what the proposals that I am aware of. No one even knows if sharding/POS are even possible in a permissionless system — which is why I take exception to the Ethereum foundation selling their cryptocurrency as the one that has solved these problems. 
- - How do you see the future of ethereum in competition with BTC?
  - So if people see the opportunity of a new good coin, they will buy the necessary coin as I mentioned above. So the price will be pumped up. After a successfull ICO process, if investers gained a satisfactory income, they will sell some part of the new coins or all of them if they decided some other projects will be better to make more profits. So that they will become the owner of more ETH, NEO etc.

- - What will happen to the price of Ethereum if Bitcoin bubble bursts?
  - The Ethereum price is still linked to the Bitcoin price. When Bitcoin goes up, Ethereum will often go down a bit until it stabilizes. As Bitcoin declines in value, Ethereum either goes down along with it, or sees a small gain. These values often correct themselves within mere hours, though. Lets see Bitcoin to burst or not. 
- - What kinds of platforms are currently running on ethereum?
  - So, as I see it there are basically two types of platforms using Ethereum for their services, even though they dont differ that much in absolute terms Since the first type of platform is hard to interface with at the moment, many projects are gravitating towards the hybrid model.  Among the second type of platform, we have

  - POW is used by ETH currently. But it may change to POS in future. But Hyperledger uses mainly hybrid consensus as listed below 
- - What do Chinese think about Bitcoin and Ethereum?
  - The Chinese people are very optimistic about cryptocurrency. The primary reason is that cryptocurrency is an ideal way to escape capital control requirements of mainland China. Many high net worth individuals can take money out of China without the government knowing which makes it an ideal use case for them. I see China has continuing to invest in cryptocurrency and remaining bullish about it. 
- - Which is a good Indian exchange for trading in both Bitcoins and Ethereum?
  - It is tough to pick one, hence it is better you judge for yourself which feature matters more to you. 1 Ease of communication/enquiry Koinex Has a telegram community.

- - It is clear that the price of Ethereum is dropping. Why does it gradually drop like a slope? Why doesnt it drop like a cliff?
  - Bitcoin as well as Ethereum and most other blockchain assets where trading at all time high levels having increased in price multiple times. Bitcoin started this year at $1000 and touched $3000. Ethereum bull run took it from $8 to $400 in that same period and the story is more or less the same for all top cryptocurrencies and tokens. One month after we are now in deep correction territory with Bitcoin and Ethereum having shed 35% and 55% of its value respectively as of writing. So is this the tulip mania like bubble exploding as many have suggested? Is it the end of cryptocurrencies? Well I don’t think that this is the case at all. There are some very clear drivers behind the recent price action. Let’s take a look at them. 
- - What are the prices of the different platforms for Blockchain app development e.g. Ethereum, Eris, Multichain?

  - We can implement a version of the blockchain without mining. Instead of Proof of Work algorithms that require mining, youll get Proof of Stake algorithms that require “forging”. Instead of using processor power to define the next block, its randomly allocated to one of the forgers on the network. 
- - What will be the effect of the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal BIP 148 scheduled on August 1 on existing Bitcoin investments? How will ethereum react?

- - Which is the best platform or Site to buy Ethereum using a Mastercard?
  - Between the two, I prefer Coinbase. Coinbase is the world’s largest Bitcoin broker, and also offers an exchange, a wallet, and developer API. In other words, it is a webbased digital wallet that allows you to send and receive Bitcoins. At the time of writing, you can also buy and see Ethereum Cryptocurrency 2.0 and Litecoin through Coinbase. 
- - What is your view on the future of blockchain & cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin/Ethereum in India?
  - Today, fixed deposits give you a return of 67 per cent/annum. Long term bonds give you a return of around 8per cent/annum. Gold, for which Indians have insatiable appetite, has historically not delivered more than 10 per cent CAGR since the last 30 years. Equities Stocks which are much better have delivered good returns at 17 per cent CAGR for more than two decades now.

- - Can Cardano ADA reach the same price as Bitcoin BTC or Ethereum ETH?
  - That’s unrealistic. Not only because of the insane growth it would be, but also if you look at Bitcoin and Ethereum prices right nowmost likely they will grow even more, then ADA would have an enormous amount of Market Cap. As of now I hardly believe it will come anywhere close to that number. 
- - How does someone go about buying Ripple, Litecoin, Ethereum, etc.?
  - Why Binance is good ? Trading instruments cryptocurrencies 
- - Where is Ethereum on the stock market?
  - Ethereum is not a Stock. It’s traded on Cryptocurrency Exchanges or available through Coin vendors. Hello! Well, Ethereum are on the crypto markets and not on the Stock Exhanges. You need to register with a crypto exchange like Binance. 
- - Do tokens that use the Ethereum platform rely on the continued development and success of Ethereum in order to continue operations and to succeed?
  - Directly it seems, YES Indirectly though, NO What do I mean? Yes, ETH based coins rely on the ETH base layer. Let’s work with a bad off the top of my head example. It’s kind of like writing an app in C++ code. If all of a sudden C++ code was to disappear and not be usable  yes, your app would be gone. But  before this happened, you could always switch your code easily to a similar language right? And thus your app would still be alive.

  - The whole idea about investing is making sure that you get your returns right? All you need to do is but on CCEX using bitcoin and also selling. The good thing about it is that you can buy and keep which is also suggested. It is also one of the ways one can make money with bitcoin in Nigeria. When you buy, you hold for a while. then sell when the price goes up. You cannot buy altcoin in nigeria directly. For that you have to buy bitcoin first and thwn exchange it with altcoins. 
- - What are the options for me to purchase Litecoin or Ethereum in the UK?
  - You can buy litecoins for fiat on these exchanges You may think the most straightforward way to purchase would be to buy litecoin via fiat wire transfer using an exchange, but this can be a tedious process for a number of reasons. Some major bitcoin exchanges like BTC China and Coinbase do not handle litecoin transactions at present.

- - Considering the Ledger Nano S is on a back order, whats the best way to store Bitcoin and Ethereum?
  - You set it up first time and it gives you a 12 or 24 word list, this is called your key phrase. This is then unique to your, think of it as a fingerprint. The founder also announced yesterday that they are working on a Monero integration too. Other wallets Hardware devices store your “private keys” in “cold storage” which mean they will never be exposed to the internet or malicious software/hackers. They are the most secure way to hold your cryptocurrencies. A Swiss bank account in your pocket. 
- - What is the most profitable way to invest in Ethereum, buying it or mining it?
  - Buy Or Mine? What should investors do? What about the coins left to mine? They are worth billions. You can get some of those coins by mining. There are two pricesensitive ways to do so. The first requires a very low cost source of plentiful electricity. Iceland is good. Venezuela is better. DYODD do your own due diligence on local laws. So, you may estimate how many eth you will mine. Then you need to think if eth will continue to grow, and here is no reliable data for you. 
- - Will ethereum hit 250 tonight just because people mention the word China?
  - Yes but you would be silly to think the rise in price is simply because of china exchange listings. There is a world of technical and market issues that relate to this.

  - No verification is required and no comissions applied! For further questions please ask!  are you in stop loss mode? if yes, switching around isn’t going to help much, but good luck. 
- - How does the emergence of ethereum compare to the early days of bitcoin?
  - Bitcoin was the trailblazer. In the early days of bitcoin people like myself involved were seen as literally insane for putting their time, effort and money into “digital monopoly money”. We have come a long, long way since then. Ethereum has hurdles ahead of it, but they are almost entirely technical and strategic, which from a community perspective is far easier. That is not to say that the way ahead for ethereum will not be without hurdles there will be many more, especially for the ethereum foundation technically, but ethereum will never have to overcome the social or political hurdles that bitcoin had to wrestle with. 
- - Im going to short Bitcoin and Ethereum. Will I be correct and make as much shorting as those who went long?
  - Whilst I agree with you completely the hype on crypto is over the top, and the valuations absurd, shorting would be a mistake. Look at the great shorts of all time. Enron, the “big short” short. Pets.com… the classics. They all have something in common. They sucked BEFORE they crashed. Your odds in winning a short play go up measurably if it is an underperforming short. Shorting the big winners is for tourists, and tourists always get fleeced by the markets. 
- - Should I become an expert in Crypto before I learn Solidity and create projects on Ethereum?
  - I wouldn’t hold yourself to the standard of ‘expert’, but having a good understanding of the Bitcoin blockchain before diving into Solidity is a good idea. Bitcoin’s documentation is better than what has been produced by the Ethereum community. The reason for this is simple Bitcoin is over 8 years old now, while Ethereum is not even two years old. Most Ethereum developers are improving the protocol as opposed to making it accessible to a wider audience. 
- - What is Ethereum Fog?
  - Ehtereum Fog ETF is hard fork of Ethereum which is based on decentralized computer using fog technology. This fork is meant to solve the scalability issue which has become more apparent in the world of Ethereum over the past few months. Some exchange sites like Binance has just recently completed the distribution of Ethereum Fog ETF. 
- - Considering the price hike of BCH can we expect the same for Ethereum in the near future?
  - INSTEAD I THINK IT WILL ETHEREUM WILL SURPASS BITCOINS IN NEAR FUTURE. 
- - Will Ethereum scale as time progresses and adoption increases?
  - It’s also a powerful system with a world of flexibility. This is what makes Ether superior to Bitcoin in the eyes of many analysts, technophiles, and investors. The future for Ethereum looks bright it is building a new and better infrastructure for the internet and its true value is much greater than its current valuation. I would expect at least 500 USD by the end of the year. Content Director For Cryptosomniac Cryptocurrencies ————————————————————————————— 
- - What is the chance of the Ethereum value going up if Bitcoin forks?
  - Original Question “What is the chance of the Ethereum value going up if Bitcoin forks ?” This is fairly an opinionistic answer to the scenario where Bitcoin core forks into Bitcoin Unlimited or Bitcoin Cash from Bitcoin Core. Ethereum Value, I believe will drop for a short while before becoming stable at a fiat price equivalent much lower than what it was before. 
- - Why does Chinas stake in Bitcoin and Ethereum matter so much?
  - China dominates by sheer numbers. They have a huge population which translates into a higher percentage of Bitcoin and Ethereum miners, users, consumers, etc. The Chinese gov’t is trying to figure out how to harness this beast. No one really believes that cryptocurrencies are going away. But they also don’t know how the existing banking system can coexist along side of a smarter technology. So naturally there is resistance against anything that is new and threatens existing conventions. On the other side of the cryptocoin, if there is profit to be made, especially where there is high risk/high reward there exists the perfect storm for those who are willing to risk it all for big potential profits, even if the risks are astronomical. After all, the Far East is the gambling capital of the world. 
- - Does Ethereum or Litecoin have split challenges like Bitcoin?
  - Are you talking about hard forks or code changes? If so Ethereum already did which is why there is ETH and ETC which is Ethereum Classic. It was due to a hack of the DAO funds and the founders decided to recoup the hacked funds. Those who disagreed with it, founded Ethereum Classic. As for Litecoin, there are not planned hard forks at this time. 
- - What do you guys have to say about Ethereum when it is said that it can beat the value of Bitcoin in future?
  - Yes, it can easily beat bitcoin in future. In fact the fight has already begun and Ethereum is easily winning. Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain based platform. It is more than a cryptocurrency. Using Ethereum you can create any software or application or you can create your own startup or even your own company just sitting in home. Whereas bitcoin is just a cryptocurrency. Almost the entire Information technology industry is using Ethereum now. Helpful links 
- - What is a good price point for a 6 GPU Ethereum rig complete with PSU and case?
  - Thats not enough information to tell. If you look at what GPUs are in it, the kind of PSU, the type of case, the type of motherboard, the type of CPU, and every other component and add up the cost, they you only have to decide how much you think the time and expertise put into the rig costs to figure out a fair price. 
- - Why is the price of a lot of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, etc have fallen in the last 3 days?
  - This is a great question. I for one think that there has been a lot of year end profit taking with a little of OMG get me out! Earlier today Dec 22 it looked like th bottom had fallen out with many cryptocurrencies down 30–40%. I for one just thought now is a great time to buy some. I hold a long term philosophy on many of these cryptocoins of 3–5 years so a big blip like today is a Merry Christmas in deed. Great Stuff on My Youtube Channel Because they spiked like crazy. 
- - Is it possible to mine Ethereum using a gaming PC? If yes, which one should I buy?

- - Is it safe to buy ethereum at todays rate of $220? Which cryptocurrency will rise in 2017-18, and is Torcoin good?
  - I bought in at 8$. I had the same question in my mind. I sold a part at 50$ thinking it would go down, but it has quadrupled since. My friends bought in at 40$. They had the same question. The 5xed their money. On the long run, it seems like it is a great investment. But if you will panic sell when it goes down. It could be very bad. Always invest money that you are okay with loosing, and wont significantly affect your life.

  - I just don’t seem to understand why so many people want to buy ethereum with INR. 
- - What would happen if I sent LTC to an Ethereum address?
  - They would likely receive your LTC, and whatever happens beyond that is beyond us. Hope that helped  
- - Will it be beneficial to buy ethereum instead of bitcoin to purchase IOTA?
  - It depends, but usually it differs from time to time. It may be beneficial to buy with Bitcoin, at other times with Ethereum. On Bitfinex where I trade I rarely trade Ethereum to Iota. I usually buy IOTA with USD, as iota has IOTA/USD market. If you have usd, there is not point in buying Ethereum or Bitcoin, you can purchase IOTA directly. According to USD value, all prices are nearly same. And in the same exchange it remains same whether you buy with ETH or BTC. 
- - What is my ethereum address that I need to login the free ethereum mining websites I have made an ethereum wallet?
  - Where have you made you wallet? I only know about Coinbase app. If you have Coinbase app then i can help you.

Make sure not to you keep it safe. Now paste it on the site where you need it. 
- - I have my Ethereum in Binance. After the fork, when can I expect to receive my EtherZero?
  - You will not get Ether zero as you were storing your ethereum in a wallet for which you dont have private keys. You should store your ETH in a wallet that would support ETZ and gives you access to your private keys. 
- - What is the relationship between the ethereum blockchain and the smart contracts scripts and the ethereum currency?
  - In a nutshell there is smart contracts blockchain along with ether coins blockchain. They work together pretty well in close connection. Whenever smart contract is executed having satisfied the conditions mentioned by two parties, one of the parties or both get rewarded with ether tokens. They have direct connection to each other so to speak. 
- - How is Ethereum related to cryptocurrencies?
  - Bitcoin is both a sociotechnical System and a crypto currency. 
- - Should I invest in Ethereum right now, for the long term?
  - Ethereum is still a great investment in my opinion. I would say spread across multiple cryptocurrencies as there is always the possibility of one completely crashing. There are lots of other great coins on the market such as Lisk, Vertcoin and IOTA, all still at very low prices for their potential. Make sure you do your due diligence before any investment takes place 
- - Which is the most trusted platform to invest in cryptocurrencies like Ripple and Ethereum?

It’s listing new coins almost on a daily basis and will soon list RaiBlocks since it has won their voting on which coin to add! 
- - What is the significance of ICOs raising so much money for the future of ethereum?
  - If your question is about the ETH price, then let’s consider how the speculation works. Speculation is always about trying to predict the future. In the initial phase of the ICOs on Ethereum there was growing understanding among the crowd that actually ICOs are cool. Because in order to participate in the ICO, investors need to buy ETH. Besides, the teams are locking the funds ETH and it is taking out of the circulation. Now, after this realization.. What is the next? 
- - How do I set up a news publication on Ethereum?
  - Well I havent developed on ethereum platform but, from what i understand you would develop your website normally  LAMP,MEAN,etc and on the server you would tie certain functionality to specific buttons  UI  , a good example of this can be seen at Ethereum is a worldwide distributed computing platform. Anything that runs on it needs “gas”. If it was possible to build a website on it, you’ll run out of “gas”, after 1000 visits. So no. blockchains are not a place for a website. 
- - Should I sell all my Litecoin, and buy Ethereum now?
  - Ethereum it is not just a digital currency. It is a blockchainbased platform with many aspects. It features smart contracts, the Ethereum Virtual Machine EVM and it uses its currency called ether for peertopeer contracts. 
- - Ethereum is up 400% in a month. Is there any possible way it will NOT revisit the price at the beginning of the month?
  - Over memorial weekend, Ethereum dropped to almost where they were a month ago…as low as $130 dollars. Then it quickly recovered and it is now over $230 again. It is on a tear recently and growing faster than even BTC. To answer your question, yes it might not come down again. There are a lot of factors at stack and it’s market cap is now over $20 billion. Which means it is getting harder and harder to manipulate. 
- - What can I expect from the EtherZero hard fork? I have some Ethereum.
  - From what I understand, the hard fork is cancelled. There are many conflicting stories about this. Even new articles seem to be saying that the hard fork is happening this month. I believe this is inaccurate and the EtherZero hard fork is cancelled. Here’s a story I believe is accurate EtherZero Team Cancels Plans to Hard Fork Ethereum 
- - Are Bitcoin and Ethereum forks simply allowing inferior, less secure versions of the platform to continue to exist?
  - That’s the beauty of cryptocurrency and open source software it’s not your choice whether or not they get to exist, and that’s a good thing. Ultimately, the market will decide whether these organizations have a place in our society. My personal belief is that people who support something simply as a money grab don’t have the guts to keep projects going during the hard times. 
- - Should I put my money on Ethereum, Ripple, AppCoin, or other? I have less than 1,500 dollars to put money in on this cryptocurrency.
  - This is still a frontier market. It is developing extremely quickly, hence the answer to this question will change literally every day. An increasing amount of legislation is being introduced which if carried out smartly could legitimize the market or if not, obliterate it. Don’t invest all your money in single currency, always try to invest in wast variety of coins, even if some coin value gets down, among one will rise shine in future. 
- - Can I work on Ethereum without having to buy ether?
  - You can create your own private Ethereum network, mine some coins and work with them.  You have to understand that there is no free lunch. Blockchain projects need bandwidth and computer resources. Ethereum and MaidsafeCoin need those resources. Those resources are given by individuals that get rewarded with Ether and Safecoin. So to use the resources you must pay with the token that the network uses as a reward. 
- - Will we get coins from an ethereum hard fork like Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash?
  - Content Director For Cryptosomniac ————————————————————————————— 
- - Should I start mining Ethereum or should I buy them?
  - Buy them. In order to mine profitably, you have to have cheap electricity and the most cutting edge hardware. Anything less than that and youre paying above market rate for that ETH. Its just more cost effective to buy them directly. If you have some money, just buy. Do you have time? No? Then, just buy. Do you have knowledge of how to set up a rig? No? Then, just buy. Do you think you can monitor your rig properly? No? Then just buy. Do you have the infrastructure? No? Then, just buy.

  - The longer the time an operation take, the more costly it is. There are factors of course in particular storage is quite expensive with a state growth coefficient of 190x per state byte. 
- - Why do blockchains such as Ethereum use OOP in their smart contract programming? Wouldnt functional design structures be a better fit?
  - Great question. There are two simple reasons familiarity to the creators, and familiarity to the community. OOP is the dominant programming paradigm at the moment and for many, it defines what software development is. They see the world as objects. It is therefore natural that they would design a high level smart contract language on objectoriented patterns. It was likewise an explicit concern in the development of Solidity that it be familiar to the average developer. The language is even alleged to resemble JavaScript I dont see it to appeal to the many, many web developers who use it. 
- - Is Coinex.in safe for buying Ripple or Ethereum in India?
  - Hi. Thank you for your query. The decision to stop active development of the exchange was made because of the unclear stance of the government and delays in setup of regulatory framework and laws on the same. They are using SSL and have OTP verifications and Google 2F Authentication too. It is safest and reliable place to buy. i think you mean Koinex and not coinex. I have been trading with them for like past 2 months and i dont have any issues and they are pretty safe 
- - What can be a good 1-year project on Ethereum?
  - Building a decentralize facebook can be a good one year ethereum project which world really needs now. 
- - What are the merits of XDC vs. Ethereum?
  - Original question ‘What are the merits of XDC vs. Ethereum?’ XDC is a token, and a platform which runs on it is called XinFin XDC. This is kind of like XRP is the token for the platform called Ripple, or, of course, Ether is the token for the platform Ethereum. Other than XDC, there is also another token – XDCE. Both can be used for transactions on platforms and can be trade with other available cryptocurrencies in the market. 
- - What encryption mining algorithm is ethereum mined on?
  - Hi Justin, I still getting up to speed on Ethereum, but found this 
- - When Ethereum hits $1000 is it likely going to dip?
  - Yes. And it is also likely that it will rally. Or wander around sideways for awhile. If you base your trading on what people on Quora or anywhere else “predict,” then you’ll fail; it’s simple as that. Ethereum has a selloff dip at every new plateau. Miners need to pay their electrical bills and whales need to take profit to buy more whale food.
