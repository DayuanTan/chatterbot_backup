  - Well, it depends. As a starting point, one would derive the price of an orange based on two things how much someone is trying to sell it for, and how much another person is trying to buy it for.

But if they agree on a price that works for both, let’s say USD2.25, then the transaction will happen. If it’s winter there might be more people wanting to buy oranges, so the price will go up. Or if there is a drought the supply of oranges will become less, so more people are trying to buy less oranges, which can also drive the price up.

Now, at this moment it’s still a pretty good investment. There is a risk, but at this growth rate, the risk is really low, and the expected gains are really high. So, it makes sense to go aboard, just because everyone else is climbing aboard. But for how long?

  - Answering to the Question Is it time to sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin? This of course is just my opinion.

If you are not paying me a cut of your profits when my opinion makes you money, then I am also not liable if you lose money by following my opinion. 
- - Do you believe Bitcoin Cash BCC will replace Bitcoin BTC?

Bitcoin Cash is going to become altcoin and will end up fighting with rest of the altcoins for a spotlight next to Bitcoin and, at the end of the day, Bitcoin Cash will need to adapt and survive but only time will tell if it does. Put the BCash scam into perspective this way...

- - Is anyone making money in bitcoin mining anymore?
  - November 7, 2015 Bitcoin mining is profitable, but it is hard to keep it that way. I run a small mine as an educational hobby in my garage. Using equipment purchased in 2014, I am currently running at 6,106 GH/s. This means on average I mine 0.04952418 BTC per day, using 5,442 watts of power. My marginal electricity cost is USD $0.1139 per kWh, so at the current at the moment bitcoin price of $380.99, I am making a profit of $3.99 per day. The reason I call it an educational hobby, however, is that the total return on the project since September, 2013, is 27.2 percent if I turned everything into dollars today. I keep the bitcoin I mine in bitcoin, because only an increase in the value of bitcoin could make the project profitable overall. My expenses so far are 72% equipment and 28% electricity, but of course that puts no value on the large amount of time I spent working on this. Ive learned an amazing amount about bitcoin in the process, so I consider it a win either way. 
- - I mined bitcoin as a lark in 2010. I still have the old PC. How can I recover the coins?
  - If this is true and you can recover the coins you are now filthy rich. A single block back then was 50 bitcoins. If you mined just one block that is now worth over 200 thousand dollars. You likely mined more than one. To recover those coins you either need to run that wallet and move those coins, or run that wallet and get the private keys, or recover the wallet.dat file which is in a hidden directory  but easy to get to  and install it in a modern wallet. If you still have the original hard drive and it has never been upgraded your chances are very good you are rich as all hell. The temptation for a helpful geek to completely rip you off or lie about how many coins you have and abscond with some is VERY HIGH. So be really careful.

  - Technically, it is hard to tax bitcoin. Because bitcoins are anonymous. But when you convert bitcoins to euros or to USD, the capital gain can be taxed. In France, for example, any income must be declared and will be taxed. So if you bought bitcoins, then sell them for profits, you must tell it to the french IRS. 
- - How much are Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum coins predicted to be worth by 2020, 2025, 2030, etc.?
  - I believe Bitcoin will reach near $100,000 late 2018 / early 2019 and then the bubble will pop. I dont believe any of these currencies will be around longer than 2025. The reason for this is that a fortune 500 company will most likely develop their own coin which will be most secure, trusted and respected globally. My hypothesis is that we will eventually only have one currency that is used globally, this may seem irrational but blockchain allows us to do this. Thanks for reading, Devin

An 80% profit is a large return by any standards in the financial markets but that is per year, if you want your capital returned to parity in 3months you need a 320% return per year, very few in the world can achieve that, we can but that’s not the point. 
- - Will the price of bitcoin keep going up?
  - As a crypto investor I hope the price would go up and may reach $25000 soon. History chart of Bitcoin also support this movement. Yes, it happened many times and there is a pattern.

- - What is causing Litecoin and Ethereum to stall, as Bitcoin breaks new highs?
  - There is no value to those two. As BTC continues to rip higher, and higher. All altcoins will be destroyed the more BTC continues to  the air is being sucked out of the alt game as BTC explodes. If you are lucky this will be the low point in altcoins. Most likely a $25k BTC price will destroy them all. Since most if not all have very little value above or beyond Bitcoin.

  - Long before we reach the point of all coins being created, which is expected to be somewhere around the year 2140, the generation of new coins will be negligible. The new coins that are being created are commonly referred to as the “block subsidy”, and from the very start are intended to become less and less significant. The security model of Bitcoin is based on each transaction paying for it’s own security, with fees. Then why do we need this block subsidy to begin with?

If you’re worried about current price of Bitcoin, that it’s too much for you to buy a couple of coins, you can always go into it and start very slow and small, just put as much as you can without risking it, but then, in a couple of years it can pay you back.

- - How low can the Bitcoin price go?
  - I believe that Bitcoin will fall to some lowvolume and lowvolatility accumulation zone near 45k before making next cycle up. This does not that it cant bounce even to 13k  but that wont get us to new ATH in near future. For adults, this scenario is definitely not very good, since the money would start to leak away from the crypto market, causing a drop in trading volumes. This looks similar to events after bubblepop scenario in 20142015 when nobody was interested in crypto.

- - How much is the lowest you are expecting bitcoin to hit in 2018?
  - Honestly, noone knows. I don’t care how many charts and graphs and models and Fibonacci spirals the ‘experts’ throw out there, the answer is this We.Don’t.Know Yes, we can predict. Yes, we can look at history. Yes, we can speculate. But the simple fact is that too many factors are happening too quickly in the cryptocurrency/Bitcoin realm that nothing is certain and everything is uncertain. How so? Well off the top of my head these are some of the things we’ve seen in the last few months 
- - When do you think Bitcoin will dip down again?
  - Stay away from scammers  Message to scammers  “Please stop telling people to buy Bitcoin, they will lose a lot of money because of you.” Don’t buy cryptocurrencies in a hurry for a high price, wait for the right time. I think you have got your answer, I generally don’t get time to write here but i want people to know about these facts. Happy Trading!!

  - Its not stable, because its value will increase upon its depletion because of its behavior being similar to both asset and currency and restricted amount in circulation, their rise in price will encourage buyers to sell it, which will depreciate its price due increase in supply and decrease in demand but if this confusion is resolved it could become unimitable universal currency. Ideal currency should follow laws of thermodynamics and should be constant and limited in numbers allowing zero deflation .

  - I agree that the government, particularly the IRS, is inherently suspicious of anything that is hard to track through their conventional audit methods.

If you buried a dollar that was printed in 1912, which would be worth about $20 now, and then used it to buy something at the dollar store you would have suffered a big loss $19, since that paper was worth more when it was made than when it was spent. The problem is that you cant take that loss, since a dollar  by law  is always worth just that and only that  the face value, $1.

It is going to be a universal currency. 2. It is going to be a digital currency. 3. It is going to be a currency that enables money to move across the world as fast and free as email. THREE massive REVOLUTIONARY reasons that give it value. Look at a mine. Do you really think that warehouse filled with supercomputers is comparable to a tray of tulip bulbs? A tulip could buy you a house in the Tulip Mania. Bitcoin is nothing like that. Nor is it anything like a modern bubble such as the Housing Bubble which was a 2 TRILLION dollar bubble.

He claims it will ‘end badly’ whatever ends well? and in the same breath objects to the suggestion that he would short it because ‘Why would I short something I don’t know anything about.’ So he says he has no idea what he is talking about. Just because you are a brilliant investor, if you say you know nothing about something, why offer an opinion on it as an investment vehicle? Really he is wrong already. It has already ended well for a lot of people and this is just the beginning.

- - Bitcoin Why arent all Bitcoin mined all at once?
  - In addition to excellent answers above, I would add that Bitcoin the technology has been bootstrapped with no outside capital investment, so the gradual issuance of tokens was necessary to incentivise newcomers to the community with mining rewards. On a more fundamental level, Bitcoin security is based on Proof of Work and work in physics terms is energy expended over time, so time factor has to be necessarily involved in it. Therefore, it is necessary that POW is matched by a counterflow of monetary rewards which are measured as coins per unit of time. Hence, all bitcoins could not be released at once in this model, as this would break POW reward system since there will be no coins left to reward. This is similar to how we are compensated with monetary value $$$ amount per year for a unit of work 40+/ hrs per week. Other cryptocurrencies based on POS Proof of Stake have not really solved the problem of initial coin distribution in a fair and decentralized way.

Back in 2010 , there were people who said Bitcoin will never be 10$ worth and they are a scam. Now in 2017 , you will not find them anymore. Few days back a Goldman Sachs report predicted as soon as Bitcoin will reach 4700$ they will crash. But we saw a different story yesterday , Bitcoin crossed 5000$ , had a 300$ dip and then again picked up to 4800$. That is how volatile this market is. Now why the Bitcoin reached 5000$ yesterday ? Because there was sudden surge of investments in a Chinese exchange named OKCoin where the price hit around 5149$ . As soon as it hit the mark, technical traders who were waiting to take profits at $5,000 started selling their Bitcoins. Bitcoin price dropped to 4700$ one exchange it was 4513$ with 10% decrease in total market capital. Within hours it started recovering. In the past also there were several such instances and it will continue to be like this.

Bitpay, Coinbase etc. are not.

- - Why are Bitcoin prices dropping in the third week of December?
  - Because the end is approaching. The futures market opened and everyone got excited and the price skyrocketed. But then no legitimate investors got involved at the levels expected. It was a complete flop, because anyone that cares about where their money will be tomorrow wouldnt touch BTC. Whatever brilliance everyone thinks there is behind the technology and the blockchain, in the end its a way of transferring money. There are lots of ways to transfer money that dont have inherent value. People saw the price rising, which was fueled by purchases because the market cap is so small any large purchase will drastically affect the price, and now this bubble has been created. As long as there is more demand for the limited supply the price will go up. But in my opinion the tides are beginning to turn, and the same price movement will be true of the downfall Large selloffs=drastic price drops. Not to mention the technology is easily copied. There are 1200+ cryptos nowadays. Which means there is no value. This growth is just unsustainable. Look at what has happened in the past few weeks alone… up 10k, down 3k, up 2k, down 5k, up 3k. Anyone that believes these violent swings are normal for investments is in for a rude awakening. Get out now, please. Put your money in a safe long term steady growth investment. If it seems too good to be true, it ALWAYS is.

- - What are all the ways Ethereum is worse than Bitcoin?
  - Vitalik and the ability to influence him are both existential threats to Ethereum. Everyone admits its a benevolent dictatorship there. Although many devs use and like Ethereum, no one has talked about what would happen if something happened to Vitalik.

The principal money of crime is and remains the US dollar.

Here’s my best guess Bitcoin and Ethereum crash every January because of a combination of profit taking, Christmas/New Years spending.

Different actors acorss the ecosystem have their own goals and objectives, but inandofitself there is no overarching ‘goal and objective of the Bitcoin economy’. It is quite anarchic in that regard. Perhaps reassuringly. I would say “None” and there’s no such thing as “Bitcoin economy”. Just like there’s no goal and neither objective of “Gold economy”. 
- - Is it the right time to buy Bitcoin in October 2017?

- - Why is Bitcoin increasing in value, but not Ethereum in the recent past?
  - One way of answering this question is checking on the properties of the two cryptocoins. Unlike, Ethereum, Bitcoin is only limited to 21 million coins, and once miners have unlocked all the coins, the planet supply will essentially tap out, unless Bitcoins protocol is changed to allow for a larger supply. Therefore, the coin is considered as a store of value, more or less like gold and hence the fear of missing out has led to the Bitcoin craze. 
- - Will litecoin reach the values of bitcoin?
  - Think of BTC vs LTC as USD vs CAD. Canadian dollar is always trailing behind the American one, no matter what. Great infrastructure deals, great import/export trade relationships, solid politics, neutral when it comes to military involvement, great education etc., yet, not enough people in the country to make it count. Same applies to litecoin, literally no matter what they do, they will always be second best to bitcoin.

- - Are we in a Bitcoin bubble? Will the alt market crash if Bitcoin crashes?
  - We are in a Bitcoin bubble, but not in an altcoin or blockchain bubble. Why? Because Bitcoin’s technology has many flaws and will likely be replaced soon. It has For that reason, Bitcoin will likely fizzle out this year and be replaced by a coin that has improved on all of Bitcoins flaws. There are exactly 3 coins that have and those 3 are Iota, Skycoin, Elastos. No. The bubble was back when it hit 20k. 
- - Why is bitcoin so slow in the market?
  - About the “why”, there seems to be a fundamental tradeoff between how decentralized a system can be, and how fast it can settle; imagine trying to make plans for lunch with 2–3 people vs. with 10,000 people  one will take longer than the other, there’s just some technical time needed for everybody to discuss everything with everybody else. If you try to rush it, the group will split, and end up in different restaurants called a “fork” in blockchains.

- - Will Bitcoin become a refuge currency during the next financial/economical crisis?
  - As a currency in a crisis, it falls short because of the lack of retailers who accept it. As a store of value or a means to move value globally, it is excellent. Based on casual watching, upward price movements of Bitcoin are often attributed to distress buying. The magnitude of these movements suggests the buying volume is slight. 
- - Bitcoin is Bitcoin democratic?
  - No, it is not. Bitcoin project is open source and this is a meritocracy. Which means that whoever is able and willing to contribute high quality code  gets more influence and responsibility. Off course there are also more global macro questions regarding big changes that can create winners and losers. In such cases the current policy is decisions by consensus, i.e. if there is significant number of stake holders that disagree with the change  the change is not done. 
- - Will Ethereum be the next Bitcoin in 2018?
  - Yes, Ethereum will, probably, be a future #1 cryptocurrency in 2018–2019, it is simply better than Bitcoin and provides much better use cases.

They question you need to ask yourself is  Do you believe that Bitcoin is doing an economic revolution? Is taking the power from the governments/banks and putting it back in the hands of the people? 
- - After Chinas Bitcoin verdict, how far will Bitcoin fall?
  - I believe bitcoin will not be effected much further. It is already at 4000, it may come down to 3800 but not below this level. A lot of new users have got added in last 2 months. Chinese news seems to be an gameplan for some big guys to enter at 4000 who missed the bus earlier. 
- - Now that Bitcoin has reached $10k is there any point investing my $500 in Bitcoin? If I should, then how?
  - I would get that now. Because I remember that mistake that I’ve done. I was waiting until it will be less than 10$ but it was not happening in August 2012. Then it started to increase to 12$..13$…14$…15$…. AND I BOUGHT IT! During all next jumps and falls I was not thinking a lot about BTC and thought to sell it after it’s drop from 1000$ to 250$, but decided to hold, because I had already bad experience with that. And I am happy that I was holding. 
- - Is Bitcoin an investment or speculation?

  - Let’s say I produce a text editor and tomorrow I put it online, for selling. I put it on a web page on a server that can’t be taken down, and I only accept Bitcoin payment to release licenses.

They understand what Bitcoin is and slowly the voice passes around. They begin to use Bitcoin to pay for stuff. Let me explain better.

- - Why is bitcoin more valuable than actual gold, when “real” gold is tangible and bitcoin is not?
  - Any answer that is comparing total value of gold versus total value of BTC is missing the point here. When asking whether X is more or less valuable than Y we need a unit that compares the relative value right now just like if you want to find out if one piece of string is longer than another you need to compare them using a unit of length. Since we can price ounces of gold in USD and also BTC in USD, and say the SP500, or a tin of beans we already have a handy unit of relative value USD. 
- - Has Bitcoin reached its peak?
  - I doubt that. All the best! I don’t think so. Consider the following

  - After you feel youve acquired some basic education its time to answer this question. REMEMBER only you can answer this.

He has really thought me a lot about bit coins and how to manage my coins .

  - The Bitcoin network currently supports 1 megabyte blocks. These 1MB blocks are full of confirmed Bitcoin transactions. A new block is added to the Bitcoin blockchain every ~10 minutes.

- - Is it possible that Bitcoin cash may overtake Bitcoin prizes in the future?
  - Its very possibile, all depends on which path the assets take. Bitcoin Cash is actually the bitcoin which resembles Satoshis vision. BTC has no longer supported Satoshis vision since a small group of developers gained power of the reference client, and made changes to block size. This has made it expensive, and slow, hindering crypto adoption years and actually reversing how many companies were accepting BTC.

  - Yes, it is worth investing in Ethereum and No, it is not going to explode like Bitcoin. It means that while it might make you money in the long term, the ridiculous amount of cash which Bitcoin helped its holders collect back in its heyday won’t be replicated by Ethereum. Why is it so? Well, my mind has churned out the following reason to support my viewpoint Crypto Market Is Stabilizing 
- - Who is the owner of Bitcoin?
  - Think of language. Nobody owns it and yet it evolves over time. Anyone can add a word by simply convincing enough people that the word they made up is valid. When you add a new word you then have to get the network to support it. This is done through discussion and submissions to the source code repositories of Bitcoin. If your word is useful, can be verified as working well, tested in conversation, then it can be accepted into the dictionary the codebase.

When you get your bitcoins, using a local exchanger convert your bitcoins to your local currency

  - Exchanges are really just a medium between traders. People can set limit orders to buy / sell bitcoins for a certain price.

Limit orders allow a trader to buy bitcoins at a price lower than the current price or sell bitcoins higher than the current price. However, these orders will only be executed once another user accepts them. Market orders will just find the best matching limit order.

If you would like to try online faucets here are the ones I use. Remember these two things  To get your collection going fast, there are referrals and bonuses. Most faucets give a loyalty bonus and referrals give you commission. Both of which help your collection grow fast.

All the banks have understood the impact of decentralized currencies as agents of value, most likely they have been thinking about this for a long time. 
- - Bitcoin Segwit 2x is scheduled for December 28th. How will the forks affect the Bitcoin success?
  - This is not Segwit2x. This is a scam, attempting to capitalize on the Segwit2x name and the B2X ticker. It’s disheartening to see that Bitcoin is so poorly understood that several crypto news outfits are reporting this as if it was just another go at Segwit2x, this time without the code blunder. It’s not a subtle scam, either. From the FAQ of the website promoting this thing

- - Bitcoin What are some good Bitcoin podcasts?
  - Happy listening! Epicenter Bitcoin and Lets Talk Bitcoin are pretty terrible in the way of content. They have put themselves in a position where they HAVE to create a lot of content in a space where there isnt that much good/unique/interesting content, so they find themselves often pushing outright scams / altcoins as innovative and interesting. My preferred podcast, and this is obviously my personal bias, is 
- - If bitcoin keeps growing, why dont people buy a small amount of bitcoin to hold onto and wait for it to go up?
  - The main reason for people not buying/investing in Bitcoin in small amounts is because they are not au fait with how Bitcoin works and they see the price, currently at $5,600 and think that is the price to get involved in the Bitcoin Community. Little do they know that they can get on the Bitcoin Express for any amount they can afford and top up or add more funds as they educate themselves. 
- - Will Bitcoin Segwit2x go through, and will it cause a BTC sell off?
  - Yes it is anticipated to hard fork on Nov 16th but could come sooner. After the Bitcoin Gold hard fork, Bitcoin dropped about 5% overnight and more the day afterwards. Most likely Bitcoin will do the same thing after this next hard fork as well. I anticipate that after the hard fork, BTC price will drop and altcoins will start rising again. But I don’t anticipate the price will stay down too long, it’ll start trending upwards again towards $10k by the end of the year. 
- - Bitcoin is valued at above $2000. Is it the right time to invest in it? Where will we see the value of Bitcoin by the end of Dec. 2017?
  - Its not too late. The peak is far away yet. With only $85B capitalization in cryptocurrency there is much room for investment and not only in Bitcoin. Consider Ether and Litecoin. Also look closely at Karbo anonymous crypro, Golem and Gnosis. But remember that the market is a baby now and may be unpredictable as all babies are.

  - The most intuitive solution is to make the block larger, but it’s hard to reach the consensus among all of the users so the bitcoin has divided into a few hardforks with different block sizes bitcoin has a size of 1 mb, bitcoincash  8 mb. As a softfork the segwit is used not every transaction need to store a signature in the block. There are few more complex ways offchain scaling with Lightning Network 
- - Would you rather own Ethereum or Bitcoin?
  - I will divide my investment in both. Bitcoin and Ethereum have different use cases. Bitcoin is a currency whereas Ethereum is computational network. Bitcoin is used as money.

It gave power to people to launch their own tokens, crowdfunding campaigns and organisations.

- - What is Bitcoin, is it worth investing in? What are the advantages of having Bitcoin?
  - On the 1st November 2008 a mysterious person / group of people under the name of ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ introduced the concept of ‘A PeertoPeer Electronic Cash System’ called Bitcoin.

- - Have you ever bought something with Bitcoin?
  - Yes, I bought my macbook pro using not Bitcoin but Ethereum. I wanted to go from windows to mac so I got a macbook pro from a guy selling it in a little town near Bologna.

I was confident that there of course would be more than one ATM so I could withdraw some money from and pay for the macbook. 
- - Why did the price of bitcoin spike at the end of 2016?
  - I have an answer that pertains to illegal activities, that is probably a statistically significant factor in the spike. Why is it harder to acquire Bitcoins? Prominent BTC providers that formerly allowed US citizens to make online credit/debit/prepaid card purchases with limited id verification eg. driver license/SSN have recently shut themselves down for various reasons. Many existing exchanges have upped their ID and paperwork process for compliance reasons, Coinbase is one example of this. 
- - What will be the incentive to maintain bitcoin blockchain after the last bitcoin will be mined?
  - The last Bitcoin will never be mined. The distribution mechanism for Bitcoin is based such that after every 210,000 blocks are mined the reward is halved. For example for the block which was mined first the reward was 50 BTC. This reward was constant till 210,000 blocks were mined. After 210,000 blocks the reward was halved to 25 BTC, then after 420,000 blocks were mined the reward became 12.5 BTC and itll continue to drop by half after minning of every new 210,000 blocks are mined. So when we add up all these Bitcoins the equation for total number of Bitcoins becomes

  - BUY THE DIP! BUY THE DIP! BUY THE DIP! BUY THE DIP! BUY THE DIP! BUY THE DIP! BUY THE DIP! BUY THE DIP! BUY THE DIP! BUY THE DIP! BUY THE DIP! BUY THE DIP! BUY THE DIP! BUY THE DIP! BUY THE DIP! BUY THE DIP! I can’t tell you what to do, but I put more money into all my altcoins. All I see is a 30% off discount for everything!  This isn’t the end for Bitcoin. Despite what a lot of mainstream media outlets may tell you, this is a completely normal correction. 
- - What is Bitcoin mining, and how do I start?

  - It is one of those things that totally nonobvious if you live in the US, but totally obvious if you live in HK. Bitcoin is increasingly being used for money transmission. Rich people from China, Russia, and India are moving their stuff into crypto. Chinese are moving their stuff into crypto in order to move their money to the US and cash out before the 19th Party Congress. Russians are spooked by Brexit and want to move their money elsewhere. Indians are spooked by the demonetization. 
- - Is it worth it to mine Bitcoin if I have no power costs?
  - The devices used to mine bitcoin also generate A LOT of heat.  If you can get enough power, trust me you will be raising some eyebrows when the breakers keep tripping, and find a way to get enough cooling to prevent your room from bursting into flames, then by all means you should go for it, absolutely, 100%.   I think your best bet would be to invest in a nice GPU card and mine an altcoin.

- - Is it possible for bitcoin to make more bitcoins?

But this change needs to be accepted by the majority of users. And even then, it would cause a credibility crisis, that could devalue bitcoin to the point it becomes worthless. So it is very unlikely to happen.

- - Is Bitcoin officially traded in India?
  - No, Not yet. But as per some articles Indian Government/ RBI going to start there own Cryptocurrency and the name will be laxmicoin.

The prices are depend on Demand and Supply.

- - Why is Bitcoin price falling? Is it time to sell my Bitcoins?
  - A 1 Why is Bitcoin Falling ? Logic  if it is the technology of the future, the returns are going to come in the future. I am from the camp that is buying in dips rather than selling.

- - Have you lost money in Bitcoin? If so, how much?
  - When I initially went into cryptocurrency, I was amazed at how you could make hundreds of dollars overnight. Go to bed, and seeing your money go up by 20%. Most funds don’t even give you that much in a year! I thought I had figured out the secret to success All I needed was this magic internet money, and my future was set right?

- - Can Bitcoin reach $20,000 in the coming months?
  - There are some problems specific to Bitcoin. It is caused by the limitations of the decadeold design of bitcoin and, due to Bitcoin’s mining process, it consumes huge computational power and energy. Other cryptos operate differently. Ethereum, for example, even moves to the proofofstake concept, and the new Bitcoin issue is competition with Ethereum. 
- - Is Bitcoin doubler a legit place for a bitcoin investment?
  - No. Anyone or anything that offers to double any form of money in less than a day is a scam. This in particular is called an HYIP scam or ponzi scheme. Look it up.

- - Why is the price of Bitcoin rising, but not for Ethereum?
  - Because the Ethereum price was driven by ICOs, which recently attracted the attention of the regulators  mostly in China but also elsewhere. Chinese forced some ICOs to return money to investors and banned all new issuance. Same in more countries. There was an issue with Tezos ICO in US  the regulator forced Tezos to return most of the money to investors and the whole thing looks like a scam  unsurprisingly. So, no ICOs, no demand for ETH. On the other hand  all the previous ICOs were funded with ETH and now they hedge their positions by selling ETH and buying BTC and USD.

It is expected that prices will reduce after the Segwit2x fork around 25th November because a lot of people might sell their Bitcoins. So, it is better to wait.

- - Ethereum has more use cases than Bitcoin in my opinion. Even the Bitcoin is the grandfather of crypto. Could Ethereum outpace it? Perhaps a better question is, do you think Ethereum is undervalued given its incredibly practical technology?
  - I definitely agree with you. I don’t know as Ether is “undervalued” per se… however, I think its value is more truthful. Bitcoin has a lot of interest; however, as you say, Ethereum in several ways is more “usable” than Bitcoin. I hardly transact in bitcoin, mostly due to the delays and high fees. There are more “buy and hold” users of Bitcoin, as compared to ether. Ether is being treated more like an actual currency, as opposed to a digital commodity, at least in the U.S. However, with the upandcoming features expected to be integrated into the Bitcoin blockchain in Q1 2018… I suspect bitcoin has an eye on ethereum and doesn’t want to be upstaged. Right now, ether seems more viable longterm; however, this could change. Personally, like you, I favor ether and have been a supporter since the beginning. Due to the power consumption of the bitcoin network, the delays, and the high fees one of my transactions cost over $8.00, couldn’t really get around it at the time so I had to pay it, I don’t really use Bitcoin. I bought in at around 750, 3800, and again several weeks back when it dipped; however, I was never a longterm holder and to be honest I’ve favored the ethereum blockchain for quite a time now. Now, I did back off for a while… many of the ICOs many of which are hosted on the ethereum blockchain coming out just seemed overhyped and a lot of people were getting scammed. I don’t really do ICOs and I got a little tired of all of the deception going on and I thought it would damage the reputation of ethereum as a whole. However, there is more accountability in the previous weeks and sort of a “cleaning out” of bad ICOs going on. I think the recent upsurge in ether’s value in the past two weeks points to this; additionally, a higher proportion of ETH users will likely start to buy and hold ethereum; and this will also likely drive the value higher. I can definitely see ETH matching the values in terms of fiatequivalent of DASH and maybe even Bitcoin Cash, in 2018. Many will tell you that Ethereum will outpace Bitcoin in the next several months… I would rather tell you something that will probably happen as opposed to something that could happen… anything can happen. Best of luck to you sir

- - On what does Bitcoin price depend?
  - “Why exactly does Bitcoin have value?” Many people find it difficult to grasp how something which only exists digitally can have any value at all. By definition, if something is both rare and useful, it must have value and demand a specific price, with all other things being equal. Take gold, for example. Why does gold cost as much as it does? Put simply, it is expensive because it is rare, hard to find and limited in supply. Gold also has some uses to which consumers derive satisfaction from.

  - Thank you In my experience, trading Bitcoin is not as profitable as buying and holding Bitcoin for the long term.

An altcoin going from $0.01 to $1.00 in 3 months is more likely than Bitcoin going from $1,200 to $120,000 in the same time span. I am starting to get into ICOs and think they might be even more profitable.

But, barring any crazy turn of events, Bitcoin should keep growing in value over time, obviously with periods of growth and crashes. First, there is the matter of mining bitcoin. Warning wall of text incoming. 
- - Will Bitcoin gold be more valuable than Bitcoin? If not, why?
  - Since the price of Bitcoin Gold is unknown there are no futures, players will most likely be guided by experience with Bitcoin Cash. The price for Bitcoin Gold will be expected in the range of 1020% of the Bitcoin price at the time of the fork. Therefore, it makes sense to catch Bitcoin at 20% or more cheaper after fork for those who do not want to get free and questionable Bitgold, and wants to relatively safely increase the number of their Bitcoin. 
- - What can possibly stop Bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies?

Eventually one chain will end up being longer than the other because one side will have more mining power than the other.. and so the longest chain is considered to be the legitimate one by all participating nodes.

But a Black Swan event like a major fraud or a major country making it a crime to deal in Bitcoin would throw off all calculations. They could be completely worthless overnight. 
- - When and how did you first come to know about bitcoin?
  - I was paid to learn about Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain The journey was rough  especially as a young man who had just graduated from the university and living in a highly graduate unemployment zone. I started writing for clients and getting paid $0.5 for every 500 words.

- - Why is bitcoin going down? Will it come up again soon?
  - To anyone that is concerned over Bitcoin’s price going down, I urge calm and research. This is what has caused the price of Bitcoin to go down to the 15000$ range and it’s very serious If this is intentional, then it is very serious and questions the ethics and motivations of both Coinbase / GDAX and Bitcoin Cash. No official statement has been released as of yet, but the damage has already been done. Anyone with a conscience would boycott Bitcoin Cash and Coinbase now. 
- - Will Bitcoin replace currency?
  - I think it depends on how you define replace. Will digital currencies supersede traditional fiat currencies as the prominent medium of exchange in the world. Yes, I think that is likely. How this happens could take many paths. With Bitcoin being more or less prominent depending on which path is taken. Let me explain. I think it is unlikely that all existing currencies are replaced exclusively by Bitcoin. As this would be unprecedented. One worldwide medium of exchange. 
- - As bitcoin has collapsed, is it the best time to buy some more bitcoins as of December 20th? Will it fall more?
  - In a nutshell, Bitcoin failed to deliver on many of its promises that far. Most notably, Bitcoin’s wealth distribution is extremely skewed towards a tiny minority holding major stocks. Quoting from the above mentioned Blog post The arguments I see that “Bitcoin will stay”, apply more to the technology and principles behind it, not to Bitcoin itself. Technology is open and free, and anyone can try to use it to develop better currency addressing precisely the problems Bitcoin failed to.

JP Morgan did not buy Bitcoin for themselves. They acted as broker for the transaction. Still it reflects poorly on a company whose CEO said Bitcoin is a fraud and he will fire anyone who thinks Bitcoin is worth investing. NExt day they act as broker to buy the same thing. 
- - Are you sure Bitcoin will hit 10,00,000 INR at end of the year?
  - Personally speaking  and with all due respect to you  I find this question silly. That’s a bit like asking whether the Sensex will hit 40, 000 by the end of the year. I don’t think anybody has developed a formula or a model to predict the future price trends with complete accuracy. Whether it is the equity markets or commodities or currencies, each of them move up or down in response to specific developments. BitCoin is no exception.

Watch the price go down toward the end of next week.

  - One thing is Guaranteed when you have Bitcoin; Volatility! Bitcoin is unregulated, without government or regulatory controls except market forces, both normal and manipulated. It is also a very young form of monetary commerce, so no longterm trends are available to track.

  - A lot of things come into play 
- - Should I keep my position in Bitcoin and also invest in Bitcoin Cash?
  - You do not “invest” in Bitcoin. I buy Bitcoin Cash because I can use Bitcoin Cash. I have no reasons to believe Segwit Bitcoin can continue its market dominance because it is slow, expensive, and its development has been stalled by a group of inept and possibly corrupt zealots. I have sold all my Segwit Bitcoin because I do not believe that it can possibly be a “hedge” against anything in its current state. 
- - How do you purchase Bitcoin, Etherium and Ripple?
  - Bitcoin is beginning to seem like a viable currency, especially since reaching the $2,000 mark. Major setbacks, such as the loss of $480 mln due to Mt. Gox’s neglectful management of Bitcoins, have caused the cryptocurrency to plummet in the past. Slowly but surely, the firstever Blockchain currency has climbed back. Double your Bitcoins in just 24 hours 
- - What is Bitcoin Gold, and why is it forking from Bitcoin on October 25th, 2017?
  - Bitcoin Gold can be thought of simply as a replication of the Bitcoin protocol and coin distribution that utilizes on a different type of computer hardware for security. This replication of Bitcoin on different hardware can serve as an insurance policy or backup plan in case the original SHA256 mining network is crippled or destroyed. The same “backup plan” rationale has been used as one of Litecoin’s value propositions, however Bitcoin Gold serves this function better than Litecoin because it has the exact same coin distribution and money supply as Bitcoin; Litecoin ownership is much more narrowly distributed, making it unsuitable for use as a universal store of value and reserve currency. 
- - What is Bitcoin? How does it work? I am an Indian. How does it work in India?
  - David Malan/Photographers Choice RF/Getty Images Bitcoin – the virtual banking currency of the internet – has existed for several years now and many people have questions about them.

- - What exactly is happening to Bitcoin on August 1st?
  - So, what will happen on Aug 1st 2017? Moreover, the data they carry is not hashed along with the other parts of a transaction into the transaction ID. Hope this helps! While this question has already been answered here, there is another part of this worth mentioning. No one who is invested in bitcoin or bitcoin mining would be willing do anything to damage bitcoin as a whole, at least not the vast majority who are mentally stable. 
- - What happened to Bitcoin Cash?
  - A lot of people have been unloading their Bitcoin cash recently. Bittrex and Kraken allow bitcoin cash deposits now and people have been moving their bitcoin cash back over to exchanges and redeeming it for bitcoin as they see more value in bitcoin than bitcoin cash. I think Bitcoin Cash needs to find a floor and then will stabilize much like Ethereum Classic did after the ethereum split. In the meantime, this will result in an increase in price for bitcoin. 
- - What can you tell me about Bitcoin mining?
  - Youve probably heard the phrase let the free market decide. Its the concept that consumers and businesses determine the prices of services and products and whether they gain traction; an expression of the idea that the economic system should be one wherein supply and demand are unhindered from any government, authority or monopoly intervention.

- - Is Bitcoin Cash dead?

Also, every Bitcoin holder can get free Bitcoin cash if they had it before the hard fork. 
- - How exposed is Coinbase legally as a result of withholding Bitcoin Cash from its Bitcoin clients?
  - Here are some offthecuff thoughts 
- - How do bitcoin investors perform valuation on bitcoin?
  - Bitcoin’s price is based on supply and demand. Someone must have a good understanding of how Bitcoin works, to see that it will be something needed by more and more people. Also he must see the top limit of supply 21 million coins. Then it’s easy to find out it’s value. It’s based on your opinion about it’s growth. 
- - How does supply and demand work in Bitcoin?
  - Speculated justifications for the unintuitive value 21 million are that it matches a 4year reward halving schedule; or the ultimate total number of Satoshis that will be mined is close to the maximum capacity of a 64bit floating point number. Satoshi has never really justified or explained many of these constants. 
- - Is the MCAP token launched by Bitcoin Growth Fund worth investing in?
  - Hey people! Beware! This is one of their tricks to fall Cryptocurrency, token, Bitcoin currency loons in to their MCAP scam. They put Richard Branson’s picture and his positive speech about Bitcoin as if he is promoting MCAP, Gainbitcoin, Bitcoingrowthfund, GBminers . They all belong to the leader of the scammer Amit Bhardwaj and his scammers. They take speeches, information from reputable sites which is correct information and then they turn it into their advantage as if those information applies to MCAP or linked to MCAP. Cryptocurrency, reputable peoples pictures are true but that’s where it ends. The rest is all fake. You would see the names of fake photoes as if their team members, names, offices, office addresses on their sites or posts. By putting some positive correct information about crptocurrency, reputable people they fool people to believe that MCAP is not a scam or lie, a legit business. 
- - Will bitcoin split or will it crash?
  - Well it depends on the situation how people will react at the time of split. Generally the price will increase after the split because transactions will be faster after the split as the block size will be increased more number of transactions can be done in the same time……..like for example when the litecoin soft fork occured the price of litecoin was around 10 to 12$ but after the softfork when litecoin transactions became faster litecoin price surges to 30 to 40$ there were some extra factors also there like litecoin was added to the coinbase exchange ……… 
- - What will Zebpay do with Bitcoin if the Indian government makes it illegal?
  - Suppose from today Indian government declares Bitcoin as illegal in India then any exchange of Bitcoin become illegal that means buying, selling, purchasing with Bitcoin and accepting Bitcoin will be illegal. All trading platform companies have to be shut down within given time frame by the Indian government. 
- - Has the Bitcoin blockchain itself ever been hacked?
  - Basically someone was able to create ~180 billion bitcoins out of thin air. The protocol developers at the time deployed a soft fork to fix the bug in the protocol. Eventually the network reorged the transactions that created bitcoin out of thin air out of the network — crisis averted. No, and it’s unlikely that the network ever will. 
- - Is bittrex.com good to buy bitcoin?
  - Maybe these websites could help you buy bitcoins； 1localbitcoin 
- - What will happen to the Ripple XRP if the value of Bitcoin crashes?
  - I have answered a very similar question to this. Here’s the answer Ripple is currently very stable, and the only thing that moved it was when it was announced as Teeka Tiwari’s Monthly pick on his Palm Beach Confidential newsletter. I think this is due to the fact that not only does it have a lot of circulating supply, but is very liquid, centralized, and the issuers have the power to release more into circulation, having a large influence on prices. 
- - Is today the last day to sell Bitcoin in India, and is this true that India is going to ban Bitcoin?
  - This week’s press release by the Reserve Bank of India has caused quite a stir. Depending on how one interprets the message, it seems the RBI wants to ban all Bitcoin trading. That is not the case, although their ultimatum is still rather significant. As of April 5th, the RBI has severed all ties with its own “regulated entities” and anyone dealing with cryptocurrency. 
- - How is the Bitcoin money supply controlled and managed?
  - Bitcoin’s supply of BTC is 100% controlled by the Bitcoin software, which is now distributed globally. For the first ~4 years of Bitcoin’s history, 50 BTC was distributed to each block, then it halved to 25. After four more years, it was halved again to 12.5 this is where we currently stand. This halving process is going to continue until the year 2140, when the total supply of Bitcoin will be completely distributed. You can see the total supply graphed here 
- - How will Bitcoin change Remittance? Will it?
  - I want to thank a bunch of Quora members who’ve spent hours posting absolute gems and want to clarify that this is my basic understanding of the material and question asked. Also, many have argued back and forth about the validity and trustworthiness of bitcoin vs. a fiat currency, and I’m not here to get into that. That’s a philosophical debate only enjoyed after a few beers, perhaps! Please feel to add/correct any missing/misunderstood information I may have. Off to the topic at hand! 
- - Has Bitcoin crashed? It is falling today.
  - No bitcoin has not crashed. If fact , you can see the price drop from today’s high of $17,300 to a low of $15,500. If it is a crash, it will be much more serious than that. Moreover in a real crash, the volume will spike a lot higher than the average daily volume in normal days. So the conclusion is that what happened today is a correction. Perhaps those who already made quite a lot of profits from bitcoins have decided to take profits causing the decline in the price today. Updated on 22 Dec 2017 
- - I’m cashing out my bitcoin profits very soon. How would I do it to pay the IRS the least?
  - I’m a CPA so I think I can help with this. First it depends on how much money we’re talking about. Right now tax reporting of any gains from crypto currency is on the honor system, as opposed to say gains from selling shares in Apple or any other security which are reported to both you and the IRS on a Form 1099B. One thing to keep in mind is that if you deposit more than $10,000 at one time into any bank they’re required to report it, and if you’re found to be intentionally timing deposits to avoid that threshold you can get into serious trouble. If you’ve held your coins more than 12 months you would have long term capital gains which can have a tax rate of as low as 0% depending on your taxable income so taxes may not even be a big deal. Frankly you could take the risk and not report your gains and no one will likely be any wiser, but the odds of succeeding decrease as your total cash proceeds increase. I recommend you contact a local CPA or financial advisor who can advise you appropriately on your specific facts and circumstances. 
- - Does anybody in India do Bitcoin mining?
  - There are very few those who do Bitcoin Mining in India as it is not feasible to do it here. Let me write down few things which are the main reason why not to do it. If still you want to start, you can buy Ant Miners from Amazon USA, and set up your own mining. Probably in colder region of India. Successful mines are based in IceLand, China etc .. in their colder snow regions and are generating free electricity using solar energy. These kind of things are very costly if you do it in India. Thanks 
- - Is it a good idea to invest in Bitcoin, or in any cryptocurrency, at this stage?

- - How will Bitcoin futures affect altcoins?
  - This is the email I wrote to my subscribers on my blog just before the launch I personally think that the more Bitcoin Future markets that are released, the more publicly cryptocurrency will get and the more people will consider investing in them. HOWEVER, at some point, this speculative bubble will burst in the case of Bitcoin and investors will either reinvest in altcoins, or leave the markets. Thanks for reading, Devin 
- - Will Bitcoin Cash fall back below $1,000?
  - That remains to be seen. Bitcoin Cash is very new and I think we can all expect some volatility. At the same time, I don’t believe price matters long term. Bitcoin Cash will be useful at $20 or $20,000. The market wants digital cash that is also a store of value. Bitcoin Cash right now looks like it has the best chance to achieve that. If it does, whether it crashes in the short term or not is irrelevant. 
- - Is Bitcoin Core badly coded or well-coded? Why?
  - I’m going to take your question as being really about the commentary you linked. The aptlynamed troll is a type I’ve seen a few too many times in my career — but I can’t recall ever working with one. I think it’s a behavior that really can only survive in open source, where nobody can fire you. 
- - Why are bitcoin and altcoins dropping?
  - There was a lot of talk about Consensus and that it will have a meaningful impact on the market, like it did in the past years. Unfortunately this year wasn’t the case, let’s take a look on what could’ve stopped this rally go through.

- - How is Bitcoin enhancing its value? Does the Indian economy need Bitcoin in the near future?
  - Bitcoin is enhancing it’s value because Adoption of Bitcoin as a currency is increasing worldwide > The demand is rising > Supply is limited and short> Therefore the prices are increasing. Indian government is still yet to give it’s decision about legality of Bitcoins. Soon a decision by Indian Government is expected maybe in june or july. 
- - Is it safe to buy and hold Bitcoins via Zebpay?
  - Is it safe to buy and hold bitcoins worth a large sum on my Zebpay wallet? Why you believe on Zebpay on any other exchange. You have large amount of money and hopefully you never wanna loose that. So it’s always better if you keep your bitcoin in your possession. Because exchange are like a pool where large people are keeping their bitcoin. and if you or I were hackers we always target Big fish to hack first instead of going after every single fish. 
- - Can bitcoin be the international currency?
  - What’s modern about the currency we use today? Bitcoin was a global currency from day one. I’m not sure if Bitcoin will become a direct replacement of what we have today, but it will definitely be a cryptocurrency in future. Take a look at how we operate today in society, paid via a bank, digits on your mobile phone/atm. We spend using our contactless cards and Apple/Android Pay. 
- - There will only be 21 million Bitcoins. There are people losing their password or pass away everyday. Will there be a day when majority of the Bitcoins are all forgotten and there are no more liquidity in Bitcoin?
  - The situation you are talking about is correct. People especially early on are going to lose their passwords/PK and not be able to get in. This is more than enough liquidity to keep the ecosystem going strong, even in a scenario where 95% have been ‘expunged’. Edit corrected the definition of a satoshi 
- - Did you invest in bitcoin? Or do you regret not investing in it?

- - Is BrickCoin the next Bitcoin?
  - Many say that crypto isnt a safe market. I disagree as I believe that the decentralized nature of it makes it much safer than regular currency. Whatever your beliefs, it is important to diversify your holdings in cryptocurrency. Sure, you could buy some bitcoin or ethereum but you might make 1000% over the next two years, which is nothing in the crypto world. this is why you want to buy 5–10 different alt coins. Birckcoin may be one of them, but what you want to do is look for undervalued coins. To do this, follow some simple rules 
- - How will all bitcoin miners go obsolete after all 21 million bitcoins have been mined?
  - No. Miners will not go obsolete not even remotely close even after the last Bitcoin is generated. Based on estimates, this will occur some time around 2140. The network will still need to be secured in order for Bitcoin transactions to go through. In order to achieve this, miners will need to continue mining blocks so the network can verify/secure every transaction on the publicly distributed ledger aka Blockchain. 
- - Is Bitcoin analogous to the dotcom bubble?
  - No. the tech bubble analogy is inaccurate for Bitcoin. It might apply to the initial coin offering market and utility cryptocurrencies. Fear of the unknown is a deepseated emotion. When people hear a new proposition that is radical, they think things will go wrong. Risks are exaggerated. People work with models in linear trajectories with everything else staying the same and try to draw analogies from the past to predict the future. We know that’s nonsense, as the world doesn’t work like that.

- - Is there a smart way to profit from Bitcoin faucets?
  - Faucet Hub Moon Bit Daily Free Bits Free Bit Co Bonus BitCoin BitCoinker Kick Ass Traffic Bitcoin Bow Crypto Junction Data Faucet Sincerely, Travis James Yes there are smart ways to profit from them.

Mining bitcoin with a GPU is like trying mine gold with a spoon. 
- - Are there lawyers specializing in Bitcoin?
  - Currently, there aren’t lawyers that focus solely on bitcoin. Do I think that’s coming in the future? It’s highly likely since the field continues to evolve. With that being said, the type of lawyer that you may need depends on what you’re doing with bitcoin. For example, the other day I answered a question here on Quora about whether someone needs a business license if they’re going to invest in bitcoin on behalf of clients. In that instance, they would need the right securities license or licenses in addition to checking state law. Certain states, like New York and California, already have some laws on the books related to bitcoin. 
- - After the Segwit2x hard fork on November 16th, will the Bitcoin price drop?
  - This is the nature of being in a volatile growth market. There is nothing about the BTC hard fork that should justify the price rising as fast as it did for both cryptocurrencies. And eventually, the hard forking of new currencies will affect the price of BTC. But because there’s so much energy behind Bitcoin and the Cryptocurrency market, it may be a long time before this comes to fruition.

- - What events would lead possibly to a Bitcoin crash?
  - A 20 to 40% correction happens a few time a year in Bitcoin and can already be triggered by a small event like one of the bigger governments banning it I call it small because govs. cant stop it, see China ban, a big merchant announcement to stop accepting BTC, flippening FUD, ect. In this case big players will buy in big on low levels and the price will bounce up again. 
- - Is bitcoin primarily owned by wealthier people unlikely to sell their bitcoin during recessions?
  - Bitcoin experiences a substantial consolidation of wealth very similar to other asset classes such as currency, stocks, commodities. Although it has a level of transparency which has no rival, there are limitations in determining who owns what by looking at the quantities held within distinct addresses. The question presents a quantitative problem which requires in depth blockchain analysis, as well as a behavioral problem, which should be addressed separately. 
- - Do you think the cancellation of the Bitcoin SegWit2x fork will increase the price of Bitcoin or Bitcoin gold?
  - Thats a good thing that Bitcoin has maintained it’s decentralisation and growth, that’s the beauty of BTC ,as Segwitx2 fork has been cancelled. Bitcoin price has been raising due to mainly , people thinking that they will get Bitcoin gold and Bit2X but now none will get anything. We can get Bitcoin Gold but many exchanges said they doesnt support BTG because they have not release there codebase. Hope the best that we get BTG.

  - This scenario is definitely not very good, since the money would start to leak away from the crypto market, causing a drop in trading volumes.

I remain very bullish on bitcoin longterm, expecting another amazing bull run you dont want to miss. But for now, lets wait for the dust to settle on the market and dont make big investment decisions.

It is not mandatory for traders to keep his Bitcoin on a “BitCoin Wallet account” with a Crypto Currency Exchanges. 
- - Why is the Ethereum price not going up with Bitcoin and Litecoin?
  - One plausible reason If and when demand for Ethereum outpaces this selling pressure then it’s reasonable to expect the price to start rising again. A catalyst for this could be when some of these tokens take off and require Ethereum to purchase. Of course, even if this is the correct reason it’s likely to only be one part of the puzzle! — They are all different offerings. Each has their own unique properties to it. Some days many cryptocurrencies go up but each one operates individually.

- - Do any of the Bitcoin exchanges support buying / selling fractions of Bitcoins?
  - Absolutely! You can divide bitcoin to 8 decimal places, and sell fractions on any exchange that supports BTC.

Yes the good thing about Bitcoin is anything behind the decimal point are called satoshis. So your answer is yes Bitcoin is in fractions you rarely see people sell one whole Bitcoin is normally .018 something like that. 
- - Why is only Bitcoin on the rise but not Ethereum and Litecoin?
  - Its often the case that bitcoin is the entry to crypto, so when new money comes in it usually goes to bitcoin first, and considering there are also a fair number of people already in the game who are selling off altcoins for bitcoins to get what they see is free money from the bitcoin gold fork, which personally Id say is at least very risky for people if not an outright scam, then you have this scenario. 
- - Which Bitcoin vendor is the fastest?
  - For you to buy or sell bitcoins instantly, I would look at sites that accept credit/debit cards. The fees for using a card are typically higher due to a higher risk of chargebacks and/or fraud, but the process is instant. Here are a few suggestions Hope this helps! You should provide more details to your question, especially what payment method are you looking for and what fees are you willing to pay.  
- - Can I invest in crypto currencies other than Bitcoin?
  - Yes, Litecoin. Same great fundamentals as Bitcoin, cap on units and decentralization, and it already has Segwit integration. It’s got almost as much name recognition, and a number of people are starting to accept it as well as Bitcoin. Litecoin has been hovering around USD $40 so it’s got room to go up. As far as growth potential, market share and name recognition it’s a solid buy. 
- - What does Elon Musk really think of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?

- - Which is likely to overtake Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin?
  - I would suggest Ethereum over Bitcoin based on my recent analysis on both. I have some facts which will validate my statement. I am highlighting a very interesing data with the help of a graph, that Ethereum has seen an increase of 200,000 transactions in just one day, rising to above one million for the first time in months. In line with price, ethereum’s transaction levels have been gradually increasing from around a bottom of 500,000 to now above one million

- - Will bitcoin hit $25000 in 2018?
  - Yes I believe it will hit the $25,000 dollar mark and surpass that. Bitcoin remains the best store of value of all cryptocurrencies. It use as an everyday means to purchase goods is diminishing rapidly because there are other cryptocurrencies that have better transaction fees and faster processing times on their protocols / Blockchains. The appeal of bitcoin and demand will continue to increase in 2018 and i predict that it will rise in value to more than $40,000 per coin. 
- - Should I buy Bitcoin at $19,500?
  - Look at this guy who bought when it was above 19000$+ Jokes aside. You should definitely get to the bitcoin boat as soon as you can.

UPDATE 18 Jan 2018 Cex doesn’t accept NEW USERS. So you can try now COINBASE which works just fine and you will get bitcoin by sending money via USD. 
- - Whats the difference between Bitcoin and gold as a store of value?
  - I love this question. It is genius. What is gold that is not turned into a finished good? It is a hard commodity in general defined as a non renewable commodity that has an underlying availability constraint. This means that there is only so much of the commodity on earth and that as we mine that commodity it becomes scarcer. Soft commodities are renewable like livestock and agricultural commodities. Of course, availability and scarcity are largely based on technology and reuse. In fact, the largest distinction between a soft and hard commodity is level of difficulty of extraction, processing, and reuse.

  - Just before I was leaving for vacation, I had a discussion with my boss on Bitcoin and Block chain Technology.

Blockchain  the technology on which it rests does.

  - Okay. I’ll bite. First a disclaimer normally, you’d get a lot of responses of people claiming that you’re wrong and things are perfectly safe. Even a 75% knowledge of the field would normally be enough to form a proper response. Unfortunately, we’re talking about security. So yeah. Before we go into the proof of work itself, and too much technical details, we must first answer a simple question, for those uninitiated into the bitcoin cult How does Bitcoin actually work? 
- - Is bitcoin a safe means to transact money?
  - Let me first say that I’m speaking as myself and not on behalf of the Federal Reserve System. Also, that my expertise is in the world of physical cash, so I’m not an expert in bitcoin. 
- - Is it too late to buy Bitcoin? What is the future of Bitcoin?
  - Some people say it is, looking at the price, when some others are investing money in it slowly but surely.

- - Is Bitcoin now doomed to fail in 2016 after Mike Hearns exposé?
  - The things that gets me is that the success or failure of bitcoin is generally judged based on the price level. For most business that are involved in Bitcoin apart from the miners maybe the actual value of bitcoin is not that important. As a business, while im still paying my bills in GBP for example, its irrelevant for me if i get paid 1 BTC for my service at £300 each or 300 BTC at £1 each. At the end of the day, to pay my employees and most of my bills, i still need to convert from BTC to fiat.

- - Is a Bitcoin investment safe in the current situation?
  - Only way to keep your money safe is keep that hard cash with you all the time. If you’re a investor, you can trust Bitcoin with both eyes closed. This is Bitcoin’s one year price chart One mistake that many people made, is to think its too late with Bitcoin when its still quite early. If you buy BTC at $4700 and by next year it gives you over $5000 in profit, what’s wrong in that? Think of the future potential! 
- - When will Bitcoin stabilize?
  - The price of any currency will fluctuate unless the services/goods are pegged to it. Consider US dollar US dollar value cant fluctuate much since it is pegged to commodities. Like, Milk is $3, the value of US dollar cant raise by more than 10–15%, since this would cause the economyproducers and Consumers to go into imbalance. Now, if we consider the crypto curriencies, there are no goods pegged to it. If the value drops by 80% it is not going to seriously affect the economy. 
- - What are the main threats for crypto-currencies like bitcoin?

- - Is bitcoin dying?
  - I’ve written quite a bit about this, but here’s the gist on the adoption curve Every new technology goes through an adoption cycle. “Stodgy” commentators think we’re in the innovators phase.

- - What is the expected price of Bitcoin in February in 2018?
  - Expect it around $1400$1600 Overall it really depends on market. if market and big tech giants like Amazon, Facebook adopt it as payment coin and government makes it as legal tender, the value of BTC could go higher, if not then it can roll back to where it get started from. So what we can only do is predict right now and keep ourself updated with crypto world news and trends. App aggregrate news from all authentic source and only publish after checking its authenticity. 
- - Is it good to buy a Bitcoin now? What is its future?
  - There is no good or bad time to buy Bitcoin. Bitcoin is just a coin which is competing to be recognised as a digital currency. This year has been particularly good for bitcoin. I can only say that the next few weeks looks good for bitcoin because of some major announcements regarding adoption of bitcoin. We cannot predict the future with bitcoin because it is highly volatile. Any bad news can topple the whole market and bitcoin can loose half its value. 
- - Is bitcoin trustworthy?
  - The ideal currency is one that is trusted and fluctuates relatively little in value with time. It has a guarantee of value or is backed by tangible assets with value which can be exchanged momentarily upon request at any time, during financial disasters or when everything is functioning predictably. Trust or faith in a currency must have these two dominant factors and there should be a confidence that the currency will not be counterfeited or inflated by those in charge of the money supply.

Hi, As of now its equal to 17000 dollars approximately Rs.1,088,794.80 and increasing. 
- - Is it the right time to invest in Bitcoin, or should I go for Ethereum?
  - This is a personal opinion. Ethereum on the other hand has a more practical application while bitcoin has its benefit as a “value storage” item. Just like paintings, you cant really do much with them, though their value is maintained. First things first. Bitcoin is over $10,000 which is technically very very difficult to invest on. 
- - Is the plural of Bitcoin Bitcoins or Bitcoin?
  - Neither Like all other currencies, proper grammar says lower case + definite article The US dollar, the yen, the Canadian dollar, the euro, the bitcoin when talking about the currency itself “The exchange rate of the euro against the bitcoin depreciated over the last month of 2017” When talking units a US dollar, a euro, a yen, a bitcoin. “Give me a euro for the parking meter” When talking multiples you’d go “How much is that in euros, US dollars, bitcoins, yens?” But… However…

- - Who thinks Bitcoin cash will become the official Bitcoin?
  - Bitcoin is the only official bitcoin. 
- - Why would the introduction of Bitcoin futures, be the beginning of the end for Bitcoin?
  - Bitcoin futures meant that the sort of people who look at things and go ‘hmm, yes, is this a scam, i think this may be a scam, let me get my legal documents’ leaned over and went ‘So, um, this Bitcoin thing,’ whereas before they’d been mildly grumbly about it. Once the SEC and CFTC care that you exist, they start caring about you acting ethically and lawfully. 
- - What are the Bitcoin transferring charges from Zebpay to Binance? I transferred Rs. 8,000 worth of Bitcoins & got $92 Rs. 5,844. The Bitcoin network fees was 0.0001 Bitcoin or roughly Rs. 116 stated by Zebpay. Why did I get just $92 in Binance?
  - You are not understanding the logic behind it. Actually in zebpay, Bitcoin is sold at a huge premium.There is roughly a difference of about 3000$ in the actual price and the price that you pay on Zebpay. So it is not the amount INR that matters while transferring. It is rather the amount of Bitcoin that you are sending that matters. Suppose you bought 1 Bitcoin from zebpay for 12 lakhs. The actual international price is 10 lakhs only. 
- - Can I sell Bitcoin as easily as I purchase it?
  - To sell Bitcoin can be even easier than to buy it. You can use one of the popular exchanges or try to exchange with the person on localbitcoins or bitcointalk.

Many exchange services don’t ask for verification for such exchange directions, while withdrawal to bank account or credit/debit card may cost you time for verifying an account. 
- - What happens when there is no more Bitcoin available to buy?

- - Why do big companies like Microsoft and Intel form blockchain alliances around Ethereum and not bitcoin?
  - Your question does not make sense. They have no need. Bitcoin is an actual currency! Blockchain just supports it. Ethereum or Ether is based on and around the software aspect of this called ‘blockchain’ Some A.I. companies are going to start adopting blockchain in their technologies. YES! This will be huge and intergrate them. I have been talking to a clearing house that told me to look for this. 
- - Is Bitcoin hackable?
  - As you may already know, Bitcoins are blockchains which work on distributed network. Now, just suppose that I am a hacker and I want to perform a ‘maninthemiddle’ attack while sender A is transferring BTC to receiver B. Can I do it? Yes. BTCs go through the complete check every single time a new transaction is made and verifies the validity of the block against other nodes. Bitcoin is theoretically vulnerable to hacking

- - Some see Bitcoin as a store of value, but what would happen if one of the forks overtakes Bitcoin?
  - In that case the value will most probably but not necessarily start to get more evenly devided in between all Bitcoin forks. That will also lead to the high probability of another, more competent, with added use cases, crypto to clearly take over the lead. 
- - So I bought a thousand Bitcoin at $19,000, and now its at $12,000. Why didnt anyone warn me?

- - What will be the future of bitcoin after the Ethereum project?
  - I doubt that there is any other cryptocurrency or altcoin that can supersede the bitcoin. At least not for the next 510 years. Of course there are many rising competitors like ripple and litecoin. The newest addition to the list of its competitors is Ethereum. Ethereum has launched its own cryptocurrency called Ether that showed an exceptional growth last year making it the 2nd most popular cryptocurrency of 2016. And for all one knows, Ether is the only currency right now that owns a slight possibility to outpass the bitcoin in a long run. 
- - Do you think Bitcoin futures will be the downfall of Bitcoin?
  - No, for 2 oversimplified reasons. All this ruckus we hear about futures being the end of Bitcoin come from people who for the most part, aren’t very deeply embedded in the crypto community. You can short Bitcoin on Bitmex, and Bitfinex. Also This community has grown around a currency that went from 7 cents to $20,000 in about 10 years. There are some WHALES in the Bitcoin community that are more than large enough to go toetotoe with the Wall Street money coming in. 
- - Where can I get software to start a Bitcoin exchange?
  - BitCoin Exchange First of all, let’s start with a exchange.

I’d like to view this in five aspects  I don’t recommend using any 3rd party scripts as I don’t feel they can be trusted them upon  
- - Does Microsoft accept Bitcoin?
  - I opened my Microsoft account and found the Bitcoin payment option is still live. 
- - What will make bitcoin collapse?
  - Only way Bitcoin will collapse, if suddenly everyone stops using Bitcoin which obviously not going to happen. If BTC price goes down, it would be because of people’s speculation or if some random wallet gets hacked and out of panic everyone starts selling their Bitcoin. In this case, there would be more Bitcoin in the market than it is now, hence you can expect a price drop. There are no major changes scheduled after Segwit2x, hence no panic scenario in nearby future. 
- - Do you want bitcoin?
  - Very much so. Anyone in their right mind wants Bitcoin. Satoshi invented Bitcoin in 2008 because the banks thought it would be a good idea to deliberately crash the worlds financial system and bet on it crashing. So, the banks did crash it, and millions of people ended up getting hurt. Thats why you see all those hungry and confused people living on the streets with eyes like broken Christmas lights. Bitcoin gives us an honest money system that we own, free from the tyrannical rule of the banks.

- - Will Bitcoin crash to 700,000-800,000 INR Dec-19?
  - Most of the Indian users are using Zebpay for bitcoin transactions. Prices at Zebpay are very different from international market. Also Zebpay dont have order book available for investors. So Its quite difficult to predict prices at Zebpay. But for international market a correction is waiting  according to most of the analysts. It can go to 15,000 USD in next 1 month.

- - What is the future of money, Bitcoin or Ethereum?
  - Someone said none. I would say both. They serve 2 different purposes so they can both be money. Ethereum has a goal to become a universe for itself  anything you can imagine can be coded in smart contracts and executed while being powered through ETH as gas.

I would also sell all of your bitcoin gold if you are planning on obtaining your free bitcoin gold. The reason why is that I think its a scam, I link 3 reasons why on my blog blockchainblog Thanks, Devin

- - Is it wise to buy bitcoin this November?
  - Bitcoin has a long and storied past full of epic peaks and valleys. When I started mining it in 2013, it was worth $290. I remember times when I kicked myself for not buying enough, and for buying it too high, only to watch it later take a tumble. The long position on Bitcoin which I subscribe to sees the price reaching $10k in the next year, on it’s way to $25k. Even still, the price right now is a little bit high when evaluated against it’s volume and other factors. It might retrace downward before continuing it’s upward trend. If you are looking for a quick turnaround on your money, you might want to reconsider, as you might be buying in at a temporary bubbling not a bubble overall though. In general, the strategy I recommend is to cost average your buying of BTC, Ethereum, and then pick one or two interesting altcoins where your chance for the 6000% gains of early bitcoin days is more viable along with greater risk. Every time your paycheck comes, or you make $, take out 10–20% whatever you can afford to invest, without fear of the loss. Buy little bits over time, and with the compounded gains, you will be quite happy.

Every four years, the block reward drops by half, and after eight years it is down to 12.5 BTC/block.

- - Will bitcoin defeat usual currency eventually?
  - Will Space X ever defeat Tesla? Like with cars where Mercedes will not defeat Toyota, the currency market is not a winner takes all market. The proposed comparison is even worse, because you are not comparing cars but vehicles, say the Wright brothers plane with an combustion automobile from 1905. 
- - Should I invest in Bitcoin Plus?
  - Personally I hold BTC, ETH, LTC, GNT and my personal favorite Gulden. Bitcoin Plus has an interesting concept and the name is very good, but it’s already shot up very much, so I’ll wait for the dip to come. I buy bitcoins from liviacoins .com and I have never known a better bitcoin service 
- - What are the best and most secure bitcoin exchanges?
  - The best exchanges for trading the majority of altcoins are EtherDelta, Binance, and Bittrex. This answer will be quite short as it is very easy to explain.

As there are over 1200 CryptoCurrencies to date, keeping track of where to trade all of these CryptoCurrencies may get a little complex. 
- - Are Bitcoin faucets worth it?
  - Not really. Despite this industry contributes to over 50% of the traffic on leading cryptocurrency websites, from the perspective of a visitor/user, it is not profitable even when using a faucet rotator  A faucet rotator saves time by allowing users to quickly visit different faucets without opening a new tab for each websites and earn a commission fee via a chain of rotation links for each faucet visited, with just a click of a button.  The highest possible earnings that a user can make can simply be no more than an average of USD1.5 a day. Unless the value of Bitcoin appreciate 100x1000x again in the future, I don’t think Bitcoin faucets will really worth your time. 
- - Should I sell my bitcoin in Zebpay after India put a ban on cryptocurrency dealers or I can transfer it to cex.io I have bitcoin on both or should I sell from everywhere as they are thinking to ban cash as a medium for buying and selling bitcoin?

All greedy fellows selling their own bitcoin to uneducated investors/people in India. Do not go with them ,service is also shit . Try Coinsecure. In summary, ZebPay states that their prices are high because 
- - Are bitcoin faucets profitable or just a waste of time?
  - To be honest, this largely depends on your own opinion. But to what I understand, bitcoin faucets are merely a waste of time. If you think you can make a lot of money just by visiting some frivolous websites, then you’re probably wrong. In bitcoin faucets, all you are doing is wandering from one website to another trying to make some easy money. But the truth is, even after hours of hard work, you’d hardly be able make a few bucks.

Many investors and people are actually educating people about how Bitcoin works, how to keep them safe. More over Bitcoin is a currency that you can use just like paper currency. Ripple is a blockchain that will be used only by financial investors. It is working directly with the banks. But XRP, its digital asset is not so promising. 
- - Which is the real fraud, Bitcoin or fiat currency?
  - You know, quite a good question to ask. Rolling in the tailend of an allnighter, please forgive me if my answer is…out there?

- - Which is the best and trusted platform to buy bitcoins?
  - a. Privacy As already stated, most Bitcoin exchanges require some kind of verification these days in order to prevent money –laundering and fraud transactions. So ultimate privacy is somewhat of a rare delicacy. But as its universal, there’s no one single platform you can blame or count this as a “negative factor”. b. Fee There are two kind of fee and you need to pay just one of them based on the type of purchase you’ve made.

  - There are different types of Crypto wallets and some are easy to use while others have unmatched security. Actually, The security of the wallet depends upon where the private keys are stored.

- - What are your views on the IT department conducting raids on various Indian bitcoin exchanges like Zebpay, Unocoin, etc.?
  - Being one of their duties assigned by the Constitution and People of India, it’s perfectly reasonable for the IT Department to survey the exchanges.

Section 133A in The Income Tax Act, 1995 Survey under section 133A of income tax act 1961 
- - Is Bitcoin becoming a career for few?
  - I think only for people who can work fulltime on that. You need to filter a lot of info.

People who can make good analytics, read announcements, understand those announcements, they can make fortune in short period of time. 
- - What are your predictions for the future of Bitcoin and other blockchain currencies?
  - Cryptocurrency is still in its very early stages, and ultimately, this race is a marathon and not a sprint. Why Bitcoin isnt the future... Two reasons slow transactions and high fees. Bitcoin has the first mover advantage, but I dont think it will be on top of the Crypto world forever.

- - Bitcoin Cash is surging since its addition to Coinbase. How do you guys feel about it’s potential?
  - There’s a reason I chose that picture. For anyone who’s ever seen the 1999 movie Fight Club — the reason is obvious. For anyone who has not seen that movie — take a moment to catch it on Netflix; ironically the movie illustrates the financial revolution we are witnessing now. Until then… SPOILER ALERT

- - Will Bitcoin gold turn into the biggest scam in history?
  - First of all, you can remove “in history” part straight away, because even if it woudl turn into a scam, it would not be the biggest in history anyway  our history is rich enough in scams. Secondly, as of today, Bitcoin Gold is not a literal scam, but it confronts a series of scammy events. For example, MyBtgWallet, which is an early wallet version supported by the BTG team, was deprived of around 300 BTC, 300 BTG and some LTC and ETH. Our team reported earlier

You might see it going downwards too Zero is also possible.

  - First of all I think you should know the basic difference between Koinex, and other platforms like Zebpay and Unocoin. Koinex is a trading platform where prices are determined by traders who join the platform and start trading. Lets say, I join koinex, and I put a buy order of bitcoins at ₹5,00,000 irrespective of the market rates. 
- - Who will provide Bitcoin with computer processing power once the current Miners have found all Bitcoin and no longer have incentive to be active? At some point all the available Bitcoin will be in the system and no one will be mining Bitcoin
  - Mining will continue based on the current fees for transactions. A recent send transaction of $50 in BTC cost me $23. I was somewhat shocked as I expected around $5–6 USD. So much for thinking. Bitcoin must remain the “gold” standard for cryptocurrency for the other altcoins to maintain value and be used as a replacement for Fiat. There are a host of coins in line to handle the day to day transactions ethereum, litecoin, dash, monero, ripple ...and one I think promising Cardano ADA and so on..the list is growing each day. 
- - Is there a Bitcoin crash coming?
  - Yes. Bitcoin will crash sooner or later. There are lots of altcoins that can beat Bitcoin in any possible way. Actually almost all of them are better than Bitcoin is. Bitcoin has big transaction fees, is not energy efficient at all, has big transaction times, is not as private as you might think it is… Lots of downsides. Asians have already started to abandon it and shutting down mining farms…

  - Institutional Investors Will Bet Big on Cryptocurrencies in 2018 Cryptocurrency exchanges which are the best option for individual investors have seen immense growth.

Through their investment plan. Here youll need some $ to start. They have 3 investment plans 
- - Which will be worth more over the long term, Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash?
  - No one knows for sure it all depends on the market I know BCC will be more easily manipulated as some of the exchanges will become whales by not offering the BCC to the holders of bitcoin that have Bitcoin on their exchange. Every exchange that does this I would question if they even hold all the funds they say they do I would not trust them at all with my coins. There is a lot of coin out there to be made. Lets put it that way. 
- - Bitcoin has crossed its all-time high price. What do you estimate the Bitcoin price will be in 2020, and why do you think so?
  - Contextualise the global factors and variables that are contributing to the price surge for Bitcoin… In the next few years, these factors will be dynamically less volatile, so you can expect that the price of Bitcoin will become more stable and consistent Considering what Bitcoin is currently being used for and who it’s primarily being used by for transaction volume  I predict that the demands from sophisticated traders in China and India will create a higher floor for Bitcoin 
- - Is bitcoin serving the intention it was created with?
  - So first let me make a point Bitcoin has evolved beyond the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto. All he intended to do with Bitcoin was to create a system of “electronic peer to peer cash”. People like to quote Satoshi the same way fundamentalists like to quote religious texts as ultimate laws of how the world should be. Hence why some in the bitcoin community would focus on short term solutions to facilitate the use of Bitcoin as an everyday currency as soon as possible. 
- - Bitcoin Are interest rates relevant for Bitcoin?
  - the interest rate relationship between any currency and that of bitcoin only matters to the degree of which currency you may exchange it for.  If you never put Bitcoin back into EUR or USD. Then  Interest rates will then only have the effect of where can I get better yield?  As an investor.  Beyond that no relationship.   The interest rates would have to be wide in the cost/benefit analysis for the relationship between bitcoins and currency or investment for anyone to really care.   So I would say as that spread becomes wide  that would be the only effect.  But it would take a lot More funds to be trading in bitcoins for anyone to care.  Has to be worth the Arb opportunity.  Net net  minimal   Not centrally controlled so the market will tell us but theoretically should be little effect over time  
- - Should I sell or hold my bitcoins when bitcoin forks?
  - These days, Bitcoin is the biggest and greatest cryptocurrency​ in the world. It basically set the base for how cryptocurrencies work to be honest. Even if I am not a banker nor a stock expert, I am a miner of Bitcoin at the very beginning for some time, and now GPU mining Ethereum. From my point of view, I would say that it is a gamble. It is about who will keep their bitcoins take longest, before it forks. Please, stick around while I explain what I am thinking of. Think of it as a Crash game. 
- - What are the ramifications of an infinitely divisible currency like Bitcoin?
  - Short answer Not much. This is because most currency problems are not problems of divisibility. If they were, divisibility is a fairly easy problem to solve in most modern currencies. The central bank could add an extra decimal to bank accounts, and start minting plastic $0.001 coins, though things are moving the other way at the moment. But what problems would that solve?

  - I apologize in advance for this indirect answer but I see people here who have an interest in BTCS and their outcome.

- - When Expedia and other vendors accept bitcoin in a transaction, do they immediately convert into fiat currency or do they keep a balance in bitcoin?
  - It depends on the organization. However, some organizations have decided to just use cryptocurrency as a payment method and liquidate frequently on exchanges. It was so prevalent a few years ago that merchants were blamed for the stagnant price of Bitcoin because the sell pressure they applied was too great to overcome. It’s likely Expedia and most vendors converts it instantly. However, there are certain merchant accounts in Coinbase that’s easy to set up, and they may choose to hold on to it.

Instead of that RBI, just release two crappy notices about warning about investment in cryptocurrencies.

- - How can I make a Bitcoin paper wallet?
  - I JUST MADE MYSELF ONE ! Paper wallet is more of a cold storage. Cold storage refers to keeping your bitcoin completely offline.

Since Bitcoin is a digital asset, keeping them online increases your risk or attack surface for having your bitcoin stolen when kept online using a custodial service. By keeping your bitcoin in cold storage, your attack surface is greatly diminished.

  - Yes, and I expect the technology to become relatively mainstream by the end of 2018. Lightning holds vast promise; it sure will solve some of the scalability problems for the Bitcoin network. However, I don’t think it’s nearly as revolutionary as people expect it to be. You still have to pay a transaction fee to open and close a channel and the fees on Bitcoin are now reaching $50. 
- - What cryptocurrencies, besides Bitcoin and Ether, exploded by 1000% or more in the last 12 months?
  - Many people belive Neo is the next Ethereum, here’s my take on it. The history of Neo On June the 22nd it was reported that Antshares was officially rebranding their cryptocurrency to be called Neo. The reason for the name change was a strategical rebranding operation to increase global adoption of the technology behind Neo. Essentially, the name Antshares was a burden to the scalability and adoption of the technology behind it, the name Antshares really does speak for itself.

When clicked on an asset from the first tab it will take you to the chart. The initial chart can easily be filtered to put custom time frame and market duration. 
- - Now, which currency is best for an investment, Bitcoin or Ethereum?
  - I would say neither  but if I was forced to pick, I would say Ethereum. Why? Bitcoin is based on outdated technology and never updates its code. The only updates stemming from Bitcoin are minor upgrades in relation to block size, etc which branch off into other coins e.g. Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, the attempted Bitcoin2x... Bitcoin can only handle 7 transactions per second. Right now with the current mania going on, there is a HUGE backlog of transactions that are unconfirmed. Imagine what this will be like when 10 times more people start using Bitcoin.. the network would grind to a snail’s pace. What’s the use case for this in the future? You can’t buy a loaf of bread with it, especially if it’ll take a day to buy that bread. 
- - Will Goldman Sachs start to trade Bitcoin in the next 6 months?
  - For many people, the name Goldman Sachs conjures up images of Wall Street financiers in expensive suits. Others might remember heated congressional hearings from 2010.

And it looks like they’re about to take the plunge into bitcoin trading. Goldman Creates A Stir

- - What is the likelyhood of Tezos replacing Bitcoin? Should I split my holdings, equally across Bitcoin, Ethereum, LiteCoin and Tezos?
  - But, to answer your question, Ethereum and Tezos do certain things better than Bitcoin. And Ethereum classic [ETC] has the temporary benefit of offering a higher payoff potential to miners. But the long term viability and likely market demand for Bitcoin is far more assured than other crypto coins, by simple virtue of achieving a massively distributed twosided network—in which a large number of users are nontech and using it for real transactions. It also has a commanding lead in weathering hack attempts and vetting the underlying math. 
- - Is Bitcoin Trader too good to be true to buy a bitcoin to make a profit?
  - It’s an obvious scam! There is no guaranteed way to always be in profit, how many times will people fall for these scams? The website even looks like a scam site, everything is all ‘hollywoood’ with fake CEOs, fake smiles and fake client testimonials! Look at this………. Seriously, even if this was a real testimonial would you risk people making the connection? In case there is someone not getting the irony whose not heard of it Ponzi  look it up! 
- - What are your views on Bitcoin and other crypotcurrencies and blockchain technology?
  - To start, let’s make a distinction between Bitcoin, Cryptocurrencies, and Blockchain. They’re a bit blurry so we’ll define them as such — So, onto stances, working backwards While digital communication was a foreseeable model in the mid90’s, it was borderline impossible to imagine that Google and Facebook would become the juggernauts they are now. While ecommerce was a foreseeable model it was difficult to see just how big Amazon could become, or how Shopify and Etsy would emerge.

  - The possibility of the internet completely shutting off is highly unlikely.

The main purpose of internet kill switches is to either prevent some sort of cyber attack, or when the government feels there is a national threat looming. What will happen to Bitcoin? What to expect as a Bitcoin user? MB 
- - Why did bitcoin gold spike 50% today?
  - If you look at the price graph, it fluctuates between 200$ and 300$ since launch. Nothing new I presume, anyway, I don’t believe Bitcoin Gold has much perspective. No one know what the future holds, but Bitcoin does not look very strong for the next months, BCH the same, BTG looks cheap in Bitcoin price now, but I don’t really trust that BTG project. It could grow 5x maybe, but I highly doubt it, and even if it does, I prefer to focus on more interesting projects. 
- - Is it wise to invest 5,000 INR in Bitcoin 15 December, 2017?
  - You may, but I would advise against it! Invest in other coins such as IOTA, req, ark etc as there is a high probability that they would give out high returns.

The maximum number of Bitcoins is 21 million by definition. It could be forked, where a new version keeps going with a higher number, but the idea was to have a limited number of coins. 
- - What are some bitcoin exchanges? How reliable are they? Whats the future of bitcoin exchanges?
  - The best exchanges for trading the majority of altcoins are EtherDelta, Binance, and Bittrex. This answer will be quite short as it is very easy to explain.

Unocoin is one of those options. It is a 100% fact that investing in Bitcoin has been a world class investment of a lifetime. Currently sitting at just shy of $9,000. 
- - Who pays the 7 billion reward for breaking the bitcoin algorithm?
  - I don’t believe anybody is paying a reward for that. If somebody did want to pay the reward, they would be very much safe with keeping those 7 billion. In order to ‘crack’ somebody’s wallet, you would need to guess their at least 12 word phrase for their private key. Those 12 words are chosen pseudo randomly, or set by the user himself. In order to crack 12 words by brute force algorithm, it would take around 30 years to guess one word from that phrase. 
- - What is a bitcoin, and how does a layman start an investment in bitcoins?
  - Bitcoin is a decentralised cryptocurrency.If you are not technical you can understand like this, imagine you have rupees in your hand and you want to deposit money in your bank so first you have to go in bank and when clerk verify you, your money will be deposited. It is a centralised network clerk, bank, government approval etc.. on the other hand Bitcoin is like money only but it is not controlled by any government it is a decentralised cryptocurrency although you will need Clerks when you are transacting Bitcoin from one person to other to confirm that you really have transferred the Bitcoin so clerk are just normal people anyone with computer can be a clerk of this network and whoever first confirm the transaction awarded with a reward that is also in bitcoins ….so regularly more and more Clerks join this network for making Bitcoin to themselves hence Bitcoin mining difficulty is increasing day by day and now very much powerful supercomputers are needed to confirm a transaction basically clerk solve a mathematical problems whenever a transaction is done but day by day difficulty is increasing as many miners are joining the network so simple computers are unable to solve these mathematical problems so now,asic computers are needed to mine Bitcoin……and now your second question 
- - Is the bitcoin investment real, and how feasible is it to invest in bitcoin?
  - I have been following since june 2016 and since then the bitcoin is continuiusly rising. In june 2016, it was INR 35K, in december 2016 it was 64K. In March 2017 it was 98K and presently is now around 82K. So you can self calculate the returns. So if you are a risk seeker, i suggest to start investing in Bitcoins as prices are expected to rise further. Go through some of these articles and you will get to know Bitcoins, from investment point of view. 
- - What is being done to reduce bitcoin fees?
  - Bitcoin Fees Explained The fees go to the miners to incentivise them to keep mining, which in turn keeps the Bitcoin network secure. They already get a reward of 12.5 XBT for each block they mine, but this reward halves every 4 years. The plan is that as the block reward diminishes over the time, it will be replaced by transaction fees. 1. PICK WHICH COINS TO SPEND 
- - Why is Bitcoin falling today November 30th 2017?
  - Two reasons my opinion  So that’s why rise and fall continues . Many made profit in few days so they are dumping. The reason behind it is that, yesterday bitcoin crossed $10000 and many people sold their bitcoins that’s why it’s falling and now even more people will sell their bitcoin in fear of price getting down so when someone will buy bitcoin it will again rise up  ThankYou so that you can buy opportunity to get in… this is a normal profit booking.

- - How likely is it for Bitcoin Cash BCH to take over Bitcoin BTC as the new “King of Cryptocurrency”? What would happen to BTC in such an event?
  - From a mining perspective I just want to mine one coin and have that coin increase in value reliably over time. I do not want to have to split my mining efforts between the most profitable coin every hour and have to maintain two different wallets, keep track of the prices, try exchanging one coin for the other and so on. Its too much drama. Why do we not just keep it simple. We need to investigate the contenders and decide on the best Bitcoin to invest our mining efforts into for safe, long term profitability and which is the best Bitcoin to finally destroy fiat currency. 
- - What resources / books should I read before starting with Bitcoin?
  - The book is focused on the economics of Bitcoin.

If you are a longtime holder of Bitcoin. This book is for you. 
- - What does Warren Buffett think about Bitcoin?
  - In 2014, in an interview famed dealmaker Warren Buffett said Stay away. Bitcoin is a mirage. Its a method of transmitting money. Its a very effective way of transmitting money and you can do it anonymously and all that. A check is a way of transmitting money, too. Are checks worth a whole lot of money just because they can transmit money? Are money orders? You can transmit money by money orders. People do it. I hope bitcoin becomes a better way of doing it, but you can replicate it a bunch of different ways and it will be. The idea that it has some huge intrinsic value is just a joke in my view. 
- - What will happen once the last Bitcoin is created?
  - When the last bitcoin is mined, people will finally realize that nothing changes. First, investors and traders realize that the ultimate circulation cap is 21M coins, even if 5½ million BTC have yet to be put into circulation. It is no different than if they were held in savings accounts. Their existence is certain, and therefore, they are fully discounted by anyone who cares to know these things.

- - Do you know anyone who has become a US dollar millionaire due to early investing and/or mining in Bitcoin? What made you decide to invest? Was it the concept that initially attracted your attention?
  - A story was published last week on Forbes about an anonymous “Mr. Smith” who has apparently made $25 million in profits from Bitcoin. A few excerpts By October 2010, Smith was ready to jump in. “I had no idea how much to invest, but I was getting paid pretty well at the time, so I decided on $3,000.” He paid just over $0.15 per Bitcoin, giving him slightly under 20,000. 
- - Should I hold or sell my Bitcoin cash?
  - Im a big proponent of the idea that when chains split, one becomes “dominate” over the other and gets more support from the network. Bitcoin appears to be gaining the most support from the market and hasnt lost many of the network effects that made it so powerful. BCC has some major concerns 51% attacks, lack of developers, etc that it has yet to overcome. So today, because the price spike, if I could sell my BCC, I would do it in a heartbeat. 
- - The market cap for bitcoin is $185 billion. If everyone sold their bitcoin for US dollars, would the money be available at exchanges?
  - Like all currencies, bitcoins are not under the hoof of a horse. However, unlike other currencies, they do not print, do not hit .Imagine that they are mined like a precious metal. However, it is not a pickaxe that is needed to find this digital gold, but a computer capable of solving eminently complex calculations. Indeed, a lot of effort must be made to mine a bitcoin, because the pieces, created by the protocol itself, are voluntarily few  that is what gives them their value. We already know that in the end, when we mined all bitcoins, there will be only 21 million in all and for everything! Knowing that 12.5 million bitcoins have already been produced. 
- - What will happen when the supply of bitcoin runs out?
  - I think where the question goes wrong is thinking of the supply of bitcoin in units of 1 BTC. There will only ever be 21M BTC. There are more than 21M people who will need BTC, therefore BTC will eventually run out! So the real thing you should be concerned about is what happens when the supply of US Dollars runs out. Fortunately, when, not if, we run out of Dollars, which will happen way sooner than we will ever run out of bitcoin, we can always just print more. sarcasm. 
- - Which will prevail in the future and why, Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash?
  - This really depends on multiple things, the biggest one coming in November. Part of the Segwit implementation plan is to increase the block size to 2MB. There are now rumbling that developers don’t want to go down that route. So if there is no consensus again, then Bitcoin will hard fork and develop a third Bitcoin. I think if that happens, it would ruin Bitcoin’s PR and might set it back for years. It might be when Bitcoin Cash starts gaining major ground when that happens. 
- - What are the key properties of the Bitcoin blockchain?
  - First up, thank you for asking a question that goes really above and beyond the hype around bitcoin “price increases 5X in 6 months”, “bought a pizza with bitcoins hence not a millionaire” and the like. It feels good to focus on the science and not just the economics involved, for a change. For a beginner, I would say that there are a few properties that are quite unique. These are not shared by the internet of today, as we know it. 
- - Why is Bitcoin controversial?
  - A lot of its support and the opposition to it is ideological. Bitcoin is a decentralized currency that is uncontrolled by any government and probably not controllable by any government. It allows people to circumvent various laws, including laws about paying taxes in the US and laws about moving currency out of the country in China. Most other currencies only survive because they’re backed by a country’s government. 
- - Big banks are developing their own cryptos. Will this affect Bitcoin?
  - Banks appear to be more interested in leveraging blockchain technologies at this point than directly issuing there own cryptocurrencies. Why? Regulatory reasons. Banks are under pressure from new regulations to be able identify where client assets are at all times and prove these assets are not commingled with their own. Blockchains are the perfect solution to this problem. Let me explain. 
- - Is the velocity of Bitcoin improving?
  - The velocity of a currency does not matter. There is a common misconception that hoarding hurts the economy. That is not accurate in a freemarket economy where market prices can adjust to the money supply. Market prices will be a reflection of the money supply being used in transactions. If people increase their demand for money, which means hoard money, then market prices will decrease to adjust to the lower money supply. The velocity of money does not matter what is important is the money supply being used in transactions. 
- - Will Ripple replace Bitcoin? If it does, why?
  - The purpose of Bitcoin and Ripple is totally different. Bitcoin is a form of Cryptocurrency which is developed to be used as mode of payment. It is accepted as currency at many major retailers. In real sense Ripple is not a cryptocurrency. The developers have made Ripple as a way to transfer money internationally at minimal fee avoiding currency conversion charges. So I don;t think Ripple will replace Bitcoin but both will flourish independently. SWIFT payment gateway is the competitor of Ripple not the Bitcoin. 
- - What will be the next technological boom after Bitcoin which one could capitalize on?
  - I believe that beyond the initial phase of Bitcoin, running decentralized nodes are going to become of the upmost importance. The newest blockchains are not designed to replace Bitcoin as much as its complimenting it. Similar to how the internet has many protocols, blockchain will have layers and layers of decentralized networks. 
- - What is the minimum cost for bitcoin mining?
  - hello, 4 type of cost you have to bear if you wish to mine bitcoin or any other alt coin but cost number 3 and 4 are not your actual cost as you don’t have to pay for it from your pocket, it depends on how many coins you gain by mining and amount of bitcoin you have in wallet as per your question if you have some kind of hardware so your hardware cost is zero all you need to calculate how much your hardware consume in terms of electricity 
- - Which should I be holding more of, Ethereum or Bitcoin?
  - For what purpose? When you say holding I’m going to assume you mean for long term investment purposes. Bitcoin is decentralized and has a cap on total units. Ethereum has no cap on units making it inflationary and a bad long term store of value. Additionally, Ethereum is controlled by a small group that can and does edit the all important blockchain as illustrated by the DAO debacle of 2016. 
- - What is better to invest 1500 into mining, Bitcoin or simply purchase $1,500 dollars worth of Bitcoin?

- - How much can I earn in Bitcoin by investing 5,000?
  - First be specfic about whether you are investing 5000$ or 5000 rs or in someother currencies.Let me explain you in dollars and rupess.If you are investing 5000 dollars then you will get only a share in Bitcoin but not the entire Bitcoin because.

But Bitcoin has volatile nature in short term But it is very good for long term. Investing money depends on your personal risk 
- - Is there a rationale behind the recent surge in Bitcoin?
  - My best guess is MITIGATING FACTORS The implementation of Segwit and awareness of the bitcoin across the globe, as the time is passing more and more people are learning about crypto currency bitcoin and its past performance over last 7 years . they are getting involved ,and so the demand and price. you can subscribe to my channel here ICOs.

- - What are the pros and cons of Bitcoin SegWit2x compared to the current Bitcoin?
  - I think it is hard to come up with any pros for Segwit2X other than it arguably got segwit implemented into the bitcoin protocol. With computer protocols, bigger is not always better. Segwit, on average, doubles the throughput of the bitcoin network. If 2x was to be implemented that would double the throughput of the network again. So the bitcoin protocol would essentially have a 4x increase in throughput in a matter of 4 months. This is awesome, right? No. 
- - How profitable is it now to invest in Bitcoin?
  - There are two answers, depending on what you want to hear. One gives you 100% returns, the other takes away everything from you.

Go with what you want to hear because nobody, NOBODY, can advise you right now on what to do with bitcoins. 
- - What’s the difference between Bitcoin and Bytecoin?

Monero has already a significant value of over 100 dollars.

- - Why is the Bitcoin price crashing but Falcon is rising?
  - The last 24 hours has seen increases of up to 300% for some crypto currencies and drops as big of 92% for others. These changes are taken from a list of 978 cryptocurrencies. Changes happen due to confidence in each currency, and the supply and demand. One recent report on Bitcoin says The price has been driven by Chinese investors who are using Bitcoin to shift money out of the country. You cant take short term price movements too seriously. 
- - What is the reason that the Reserve Bank of India is against Bitcoin investment?
  - Let me ask you one thing, What value does the green paper with photo of Gandhi hold individually? No value! Exactly! Its got all its value by the fact that weve accepted it as a medium of exchange and we all show Trust in the currency. And how does Trust arise? It arises on 2 main factors, Predictability and Stability. Bitcoins got none of them. 
- - What is the latest technology worth investing in, as Bitcoin was in 2009?
  - I made a lot of money this year investing in medicinal research companies which work on gene and cell treatment using new approaches. Take heed though, it is an extremely risky sector with how changes affect it. Granted, in my opinion it isn’t nearly as risky as Bitcoin which I consider a pyramid scheme but I think there is very good potential in that sector. Just imagine if one of those corps found a real cure to something like diabetes, sickle cell, etc. 
- - Is it worth it to buy a Bitcoin at $18,000?
  - If you are not experienced as an investor, any investment is a risk. If you do not understand market ups and downs let alone something like crypto currency….the potential for loss of your investment becomes even greater. 
- - Do you think Bitcoin will make it to $40,000 this year, as projected by some?
  - When Bitcoin broke $2000 barrier in May 2017 people were like this bubble is going to blast soon but that never happened. Bitcoin kept booming and even touched $20K in December 2017. Again people and FUD creators were like it is a bubble, but the bubble did go and bitcoin came below to $10K. Now what? Bitcoin is going to grow even bigger after this and may touch $30K$35K by the end of December 2018. But how? 
- - Will quantum computing destroy Bitcoin?
  - There are a couple of wrong answers here. QC is primarily a danger to public key signature algorithms that are based on discrete logs or integer factorization. As it currently stands, bitcoin does depend on the discrete log problem in an elliptic curve group. This is part of the ECDSA signature algorithm. If quantum computing comes to fruition, it would be unwise not to replace this module.

- - Bitcoin is taking over the world or will collapse. Both are possible outcomes. Who is doing mathematical calculations to find out when countries are likely to intervene? What would happen to society if Bitcoin took over the world?
  - Bitcoin will not take over the world. It is a fiat currency and should be treated no differently than a stock. It is rising now but at some point it will crash, at the point of crashing it could very likely go bankrupt or just be worth so little that it doesn’t mean anything anymore.

- - Is there a solution to Bitcoins energy efficiency problem?
  - The list is long. The electricity argument is just a stick to wack the dog. Not a good one. A bit similar to “encryption” should always have a backdoor, let’s call that the Microsoftisation of the world. As a system design, the challenge is to insure a sufficient delay so that while distributed nodes certify a block of transactions, there is enough time to allow a majority of nodes to participate. This, while all elements of the system are decentralized.

  - Whatever is keeping it from collapse will ultimately fail to do so, in my opinion. People say that everything is like that, that value is subjective, and so on. I disagree. Some things have more intrinsic value than others. Gold has some, but most of golds value is, like Bitcoin, a selffulfilling prophesy sort of thing  people predict its price will go up, so it does. But that selffulfilling prophesy can just as easily work in the other direction.

  - Well, now we are near the end of 2017 I hope that you can see that this was a clear YES. Will Bitcoin grow in 2018 you may now ask? Yes, there is a possibility of Bitcoin reaching 100K in 2018. Hypothetically, if just 1% of the FX market transferred to BTC then the price would go to 100K. People think this is impossible but then look at the price of BTC at the start of 2017 1,000 USD to now USD 7,400 and then think about if it becomes mainstream what the price would reach. Thanks, Devin Hi,

- - Will a new digital currency replace Bitcoin to be the mainstream?
  - In opposition to the posters above, I see the replacement of Bitcoin as inevitable. Someone posted an answer based in fallacy about “being the first” to implement a service or technology.

  - Maybe they did. In defense of the innocent, computer logic is neither logical nor mathematical. Bitcoin is a mathematical problem, stick to the problem on its own terms.

We can tell this because the amount of miners signing onto the network every 2 weeks has been growing quite rapidly. 
- - If I buy a Bitcoin now and the price drops, will that mean more Bitcoins?
  - You still have ONE Bitcoin, however the value would now be 5k and you lost 5k from your initial investment.

In order to be successful, one should split the investment into several well researched alternative Coins to split the risk and profit from the rise of other Coins. Success and see you at the top.

The advantages The Disadvantages 
- - What role will Bitcoin Cash BCH have over the next two years?
  - Interesting question. Im not particularly involved, but I think the character and ability of key people matter. Communities are organised around shared values, but sometimes the values of the leadership shift, or different guys come in and subtly the direction changes. See Bryan Cantrill’s talk on Joyent experience of node.js to see an example in a different domain of this phenomenon. An intern at Joyent invented node.js, and they subsequently put a lot of effort into making the implementation observable, debuggable etc. Yet with the influx of frontend developers the community that they had started took on a life of its own, to the extent that it no longer represented the values that Joyent held important for their firm. Values matter in these kinds of communities, much more than is sometimes appreciated. 
- - What is the reason for Bitcoin surge on 12 April, 2018?
  - I can’t be certain, because the state of the things is that in market speculation there are no reasons but just expost pretexts. I’d say three factors could have led to the surge on the 12 April Check the volume bars for that rip. It certainly wasn’t a small fish who started all the buying pressure, right?

- - Why was Bitcoin rejected by the RBI?
  - RBI will soon give permission to bitcoins in my opinion. Prime reason is its a great opportunity for them to generate taxation money. 
- - Will Bitcoin Cash take over the cryptocurrency market?
  - The information provided should only be considered accurate of today’s date, 20170821, and may become outdated in the future. It is unlikely, but not impossible.

- - Should I buy Bitcoin now when its price is above 5lc?
  - That depends on you. People are still skeptical about this crypto currency.

I invested when its price was 497K! after doing some research. Let me tell you It definitely is risky can fall anytime. If you are willing to take that risk, go invest now. If you are unwilling, go invest in liquid funds/debt bonds but not in equity/market. 
- - What is Bitcoin exactly - The open truth?
  -  Based on my understanding  Bitcoin is a currency which isn’t controlled by any government but is controlled by the users  DECENTRALIZED Value of any currency depends upon its demand and circulation.

- - Why is Bitcoin skyrocketing? Where will this end?
  - It’s going to end somehow and one day, since it’s a totally normal thing to happen. Not to yell “Bitcoin is a bubble”, but in my personal opinion it’s rise is going to stop, probably go down a couple of thousands and stabilise there. With a virtual currency like bitcoin, which has pretty much no solid ground, it’s really hard to predict how it’s going to act in the next couple of months. People are still predicting though, like over here Oversupply of Bitcoin Will Burst the Bubble? 
- - Will Bitcoins price drop before Segwit2x in November?
  - This will fully depend on the debate between developers and miners on the x2 part of Segwit. If there continues to be disagreement amongst the two parties you can definitely expect volatility as we saw 8/18  8/20 as miners have the option of switching their hashrate to BCash now which would likely cause BTC to go down materially. On the same note, even if miners did not switch to Bcash it seems that they would certainly not be sticking with just Segwit and would either fork into a 3rd coin or switch to Bcash. As a note the reason for the pullback on that weekend was 1 Bcash difficulty reduction which would make it more profitable to mine than BTC 2 large BTC holder buying significant amounts of Bcash to make it even more competitively priced to mine vs BTC 3 article released publicizing some of the disagreements currently going on between some of the major parties heavily invested in BTC businesses, miners, and developers 
- - How hard is it to mine Bitcoin nowadays?
  - It’s not that difficult from a technical standpoint, but it requires proper infrastructure and capital investment. Mining using a CPU or GPU is no longer viable. You must use an ASIC.

  - Unfortunately a hard fork will happen with Bitcoin eventually. Segwit only allows the block size to be upped to 4MB . Once it is deemed that 4MB block size is not enough to handle enough transactions, the block size will need to increase again. Once that happens, a hard fork is required. Now that still might be years off but it will happen soon or later. Really slow, but they are shrinking every day. I really hope they do because the split would mess the crypto badly.

It works on the concept of blockchain, all the transactions are occurred till now are recorded in the ledger.

  - Short answer, yes. I was speaking with a friend at an exchange who said the servers were straining under the recent load increases. Much of this is due to the recently passed laws concerning bitcoin, and Japanese retailers jumping on board.

Gox went under in Tokyo, pretty much tarnishing bitcoin in the eyes of the public.

  - My guess is no. Cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken require users to provide all sorts of information about their users to fulfill antimoney laundering regulations. This is known as KnowYourCustomer or KYC for short. These exchanges act as brokers. So in a sense you would be trying to do the same, and I can’t imagine will be willing to give you their social security number so you can satisfy those requirements. 
- - Todays price of 1 Bitcoin is Rs.7,13,000/-, is it still wise to buy?
  - I would say yes, there is no right time then buying it today. Bitcoin is at ATH i.e. all time high and will continue to do so, atleast 2017 has told us that. Thus going by basic principle of supply and demand, the supply is limited and demand will increase exponentially as and when people will come to know!

As a public transaction system, Bitcoin makes this inference process easy, which makes anonymity very difficult.

- - Do you agree that Jamie Dimon understand Bitcoin much better than the average Bitcoin holder?

Untill then, enjoy Bitcoin and wait for a $ 40,000 move by the end of next year.

- - Is Bitcoin going to fall again?
  - Yes. It will probably fall many times in the future just like it has many times in the past. Thats how it grows. It follows a sort of 3 steps forward, 2 steps back pattern.

  - After all these been through…. I sincerely think the main tendency is getting up right now. The necking triangle has almost come to the end. The bull market will eventually come from May to August.

  - Yes you will be able to do that if Bitcoin Gold Blockchain goes live and is stable.

When Trezor will support Bitcoin Gold on their software wallet you will be able to claim it. 
- - Where is Bitcoin price heading in 2016?
  - No one can predict this. Dont believe anyone who thinks they can. What does this mean? Its tricky to predict exactly what will happen, but it does mean that all of a sudden mining Bitcoins will be half as profitable. This could mean the price of BTC could go up as a result, but like all predictions about Bitcoin, that is just speculation. Too the moon.  JK.  But thats the motto! 
- - Why are Bitcoin prices so different on Bitcoin exchanges? Will this not give an opportunity for arbitrage?
  - The Longer Version Compare this to the stock markets in the United States which have a whopping…2.

However, we do not know if this will take months, years…or even decades. Many Exchanges Breeds Many Problems

  - After Financial Budget 2018, Shri Arun Jaitley Financial Minister of India 2018 said “cryptocurrency are not a legal tender and Govt. Curbs its use in illegal means”. That means these are neither illegal nor legal still can be used with cautious about what further step Govt. Would take and it is not responsible for your loses in cryptocurrencies since it is decentralized. 
- - Why are the Altcoins not recovering like Bitcoin?
  - It is hard to give a reason for what is happening in the market at any given time. But one idea is that as money enters the cryptocurrency market it first accumulates in BTC. When BTC goes on a run this new investment starts pushing up the price. Then investors who have money in alts see the price movement and move back into BTC. They don’t want to miss out on the price swing. 
- - If you had $1,000 today would you buy 1/16 of a Bitcoin, 3.47 Litecoins, 1,455 Ripple, 253 IOTA, or something different?
  - I would buy the Ripple. In addition to it possibly being added to Coinbase, Ripple is one of the most solid cryptocurrency projects in the industry. Their technology and use case functionality are improving in such a way that they may just be able to pull off ousting Swift and becoming the primary payment network used by banks. If all goes well, Ripple’s 2018 projections of US $2  $5 could become a reality. If that were to happen, your 1,455 XRP would be worth between $2,910 and $7,275.

- - What do you think of Bitcoin rising above 7,000 U.S. dollars?
  - The end is near. Mark my words, and mark them well, the end is near. Myriad people from blue collar workers to CEO’s of hedge funds have been calling Bitcoin a bubble. The news has been filled with excited speculation when will the Bitcoin bubble burst? It hit $3k, will it burst now? No? $5k must be the bubble burst. $6k. Now Bitcoin has ballooned to $7,000 — the bubble must be just about ready to pop! So I say again … the end is near. But the end of what? 
- - What are the key challenges facing Bitcoin and how can they be solved?
  - To this end, Ethereum announced its intention to institute CASPER, a proofofstake consensus protocol, to be adopted in late 2017. It has not been finalized as of this writing, but the general idea given by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, is for Ethereum stakeholders to create blocks with their own security deposits attached. Whenever the system finds irregularities associated with a block creation, the stakeholder causing the irregularities is punished by losing their stake/deposit. If it can be designed in a way that prevents the many attacks that have been enumerated against past proposals, then proofof stake block creation will eliminate much of the energetic externalities of the blockchain. 
- - Is it better to invest in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency? How can I invest?
  - Diversification, a method practised by many investors is key. 
- - How does the integration of Bitcoin Gold effect current bitcoin miners and future miners looking to enter the bitcoin mining field?
  - Bitcoin Gold has no effect whatsoever on bitcoin miners and future miners looking to enter the bitcoin mining field. The only connection between bitcoin and bitcoin gold is that bitcoin gold used the existing bitcoin blockchain as a starting point, premined a bunch of bitcoin gold, and then released it to the world. Bitcoin gold uses Equihash instead of bitcoin’s SHA256, which means totally different equipment is required to mine the two coins. If bitcoin gold attracts enough hash power, and if the coin is perceived to be valuable, then bitcoin gold may survive. But other than their air dropping bitcoin gold on bitcoin owners, the two currencies are completely separate.

Every crypto currency exchanges allow you to trade BTC with other currency as pair, so you can sale your electroneum and buy bitcoin in return. 
- - Which of the upcoming bitcoin forks will win?
  - In my opinion, Bitcoin will win. There is not enough benefit to change to B2X. Anyway, every Bitcoin holder will get the same amount in B2X after the fork. Therefore, there is little risk for investors. However, a slight price correction after the fork is to be expected. Agreed with others. I don’t think it really matters much. Holders will get coins on both sides. Then there will probably be moves by miners to push one currency over another  but this will play out over time. 
- - Why do bank CEO’s such as JP Morgans think that Bitcoin is a trap?
  - What Bank CEO’s think, and what Bank CEO’s say are usually two different things. to a Bank CEO, they are in the business of leveraging debt. 97% of the money in their fiat system is backed by the 3% the banks hold in reserve. Want to withdraw that 3%? nope, not happening. Bank accounts have withdrawal limits, and anyone pulling large sums of cash will find themselves in the radar of government agencies. Banks also have a limited amount of cash on hand, so good luck. 
- - Will the zebpay portal be providing the equivalent bitcoins, post the bitcoin fork? What exactly will be happening post bitcoin fork?

They also state  “For any users who want to maintain control of their funds during the split and ensure that they receive their tokens immediately after the fork, please move your coins from your Zebpay wallet to a wallet where you control your private keys.” 
- - Is investing in bitcoins today late?
  - Hi Friend, It’s totally your decision that you are going to invest or not, according to google today12/09/2017 conversion of 1 bitcoin is RS. 1036826.77. If you see the graph the price of bitcoin is grow rapidly, if given good return. but every demand and supply graph have there own breakeven points.

- - What’s to stop one from starting Bitcoin on a new blockchain? Bitcoin 2.0, or another, and another, like Bitcoin 10.0?
  - Those tokens however will not exist on the main Bitcoin blockchain so they will be essentially worthless from the start because they wont be accepted by any system that accepts Bitcoin. 
- - What are the legal concerns in the US for deploying Bitcoin ATMs?

  - If you are physically with someone, regular cash is usually best. But Bitcoin is easier than credit cards. If you already have Bitcoin. You dont have to fill in forms or give your credit card to anyone. 
- - Given that Litecoin is faster than Bitcoin, why has Bitcoin gained so much more adoption?
  - The key selling point of LTC, I remember it well, was that the PoW could not be implemented on GPUs. 
- - Will bitcoin drop soon in 2017?
  - I don’t think so. The reason bitcoin quickly lowered from $1200 to $200 was not because of ‘people over buying’, but due to a hack that was done to the biggest exchange at the time. Mt.Gox. Now China’s government is trying to slow down Bitcoins march, but it’s already too big to fail in my opinion. There will be a “bubble” at some point and that’s when you’ll have to get out, but right now Bitcoin is just getting started! 
- - If you had 100 USD to invest, will you do it on Bitcoin or in undervalued altcoins?
  - I’d probably use it on neither. $100 isn’t enough to make a significant splash in almost any crypto. If we’re technical, you could use it to fund a promising ICO and perhaps capitalize on that, but chances are it won’t happen. If you were to invest it in bitcoin and its price raised from $3,500 to $10,000, you would have only made $180 profit. 
- - Should I convert all my bitcoins to Ethereum before the Bitcoin Fork?
  - When there’s a fork, your coins also fork. They won’t somehow get lost in a shuffle. At worst, there might be some bug in the wallet software you’re using if it’s out of date. So there’s no inherent risk to your coins just from a fork. 
- - Is it possible to reverse a Bitcoin transaction?
  - One of the features which can be considered as a disadvantage of bitcoin is that it is irreversible. Yes, you are reading it right. Once the payment is made and sent, you cannot cancel or reverse it. This challenge has faced by many users; mistakenly they sent the payment to the wrong recipient and after that could not cancel it. These cryptocurrencies are designed in such a way that they cannot be reversed and one cannot have a control over them. So, while making a transaction you need to be very careful as they provide as once the payment is sent you will not be able to reverse it and may suffer huge loss. 
- - Can Bitcoin be centralized?
  - You’d have to control 51% of the Bitcoin network in order to do that, which even the NSA would have trouble pulling off with the size of the network. So the core protocol is going to remain decentralized for the most part. However, parts of the ecosystem may succumb to centralization like exchange in various countries, which can have similarly detrimental effects on the network. 
- - Will Bitcoin fall further due to the possible Bitcoin cash fork?
  - The whole debate about a potential hardfork is entirely “manufactured” by certain big Bitcoin players in order to generate confusion, depress the price of Bitcoin and artificially create volatility in the market for the profit of said players. Please also see my other answer below How much will the price of bitcoin fall? 
- - What is the procedure to invest money in Bitcoin?
  - If I could help with anything else please drop a comment. P.S. if you found this informative, please upvote ✌️ Dear Friend, There are many ways by which you can invest in bit coin as well as other crypto currencies in india. but don’t forget the risk behind these investment without understanding what a crypto is. The volatility in bitcoin or other crypto may empty your pocket in a day or may make you rich in a day too. 
- - What is special about Einsteinium EMC2? How is it different from Bitcoin and IOTA?
  - Einsteinium Research is not everything however, they are also looking to improve education as well as internet technology developments. They want to take it to another level from what they’ve stated. They believe that education is the key to success with any movement. And they are dedicated to spreading their beliefs around the world. They want to create a system that is based on solid, foundational goals and spread their knowledge across the globe. Bitcoin 
- - Is it the right time to buy Bitcoin at $8700?
  - I look at it simply. The price of any product or commodity is dependent upon supply and demand. Bitcoin’s ultimate supply is set no one will ever be able to print unlimited numbers of them from thin air like the Federal Reserve does with the American Dollar. So demand is the BIGGEST part of determining its value. This new ‘decentralized’ peertopeer system opens the door to any individual of any walk of life to buy and/or sell bitcoin. Everyone and anyone from all countries have free and direct access to this new decentralized space playing field without a need for brokers or third party intermediaries. While this is a benefit in so many ways, it also lends itself to emotional moves caused by speculation, excitement, panic and that new FOMO virus Fear of Missing Out. Some people have bitcoin knowledge and know what they are talking about and some people absolutely don’t, but they are all talking… and people are listening… it has been crazy.. but it’s also very exciting  because although it will evolve and there’ll be challenges and ups and downs, its not going away. The Internet as we know it today may … but the blockchain won’t … because its the new Internet. 
- - Is bitcoin mining profitable through bitcoin India and is it legal?
  - Well there is nothing illegal about it at the moment but taking into account the electricity cost and the increased rate of rigs at the moment, it is not profitable. I would not recommend to mine Bitcoin now, though some alt coins may be considered. 
- - Should I buy Bitcoin at $4550, or can I wait for a dip?
  - Definitely, you should buy! One mistake that many people made, is to think its too late when its still quite early. Bitcoin has great potential to cross $10,000 by next year. Mainly because with more exposure to Bitcoin and its return, demand of Bitcoin is increasing but its production won’t increase. We already have 16.5M Bitcoin in market out of 21M. When new Bitcoin’s creation will stop, you can expect Bitcoin’s price to touch new high with new high, I mean very large amount. 
- - Are there any commercial places in India accepting Bitcoin as payment?
  - What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a new currency that was created in 2009 by an unknown person using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. Transactions are made with no middle men – meaning, no banks! Why Bitcoins? 
- - Should I sell my bitcoin before the hard fork?
  - I recently advised someone about the same, and I will tell you the same as well. I will suggest you two ways This is just a friendly advice from my side, as I say, DYOR. Upvote if you like  Its hard to predict the spikes and crashes of Bitcoin. For the BTG fork, which was way worse of a free coin, Bitcoin hit just about $6K and then plummeted $500 instantly into Alts right at the fork block. 
- - For a first time investor, Bitcoin or Ethereum? And more importantly why?
  - Bitcoin is a decentralized currency, while Ethereum is a blockchain based platform. Bitcoin is deflationary with a limited number coins 21 million coins. Ethereum is a platform on which Dapps Decentralized Applications Can run off it. It also has smart contract applications. They’re like Gold vs Aluminum. Future of Bitcoin and Ethereum 
- - Are virtual currencies like Bitcoin and Ether the future for the average consumer?
  - I’ve spent a bit of time over the past several months reading a lot of ICO white papers and talking with people in various areas of the cryptocurrency space. It seems inevitable to me that at some future point, some form of cryptocurrency will be in daily use by average people. We aren’t yet at that point, and it will take quite a lot of development from where we are now to get to that point. Things that need to be figured out 
- - Will Ethereum’s Byzantium hard fork cause a new coin to form, like with Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash?
  - OK, so what I’ve learned is that this whole subject starts with an upgrade. The block chain is getting an upgrade and people are calling it a “hard fork”. the term hard fork, to me at least, implies the block chain will split. This is not neccesarily true. … it could split. If the mining community is split with some in favor and some opposed to the upgrade they can force a hard fork and split the chain into the upgrade version and the original version like what happened with Bitcoin and bitcoin cash. Ethereum is not expected to hard fork even everyone is calling the upgrade a hard fork, even though it is really just an upgrade. The community, so far as we’ve discovered, is uniformly in favor of the upgrade or at least willing to do it so no hard fork is expected. On the topic of new coins… if the upgrade is successful and everyone agrees to it then there will be no hard fork. If the upgrade is only partially successful and some of the community force a split and cause a hard fork then yes, a new coin will be formed. 
- - Is the bubble going to burst on the bitcoin boom?
  - Probably not. Pension funds, reliant on high interest rates are left with high risk investments that havent been successful, they’re are losing money. The only alternative is investing in inflation proof assets. I’m going to have to say no. 
- - How can Bitcoin be considered a serious currency, if it is limited to only 21 million Bitcoins that will ever be issued?
  - Bitcoin is a lot more granular than the dollar. While the smallest amount of dollar you can transact is $0.01 1 cent, bitcoin can be subdivided to upto 8 decimal places 0.00000001 BTC or 1 Satoshi. So even though there are only 21 million bitcoins, it is possible to have 21 trillion satoshis that far exceeds the total number of individuals that will ever stay alive at the same time. 
- - What are the best small crypto coins to buy and hold before bitcoin futures start?
  - Cardano With over 1,200 Cryptocurrencies to invest in, many projects are overlooked, especially in their infancy. Take Ethereum for example, when Ethereum first came onto the markets in 2015 the price was less than 1 USD. As the wider community became aware of the value of the blockchain ETH is built on, they started to invest substantially in it, hence the increase in price above.

You will not become a millionaire in a life by collecting Satoshis this way, but its fun and its free. 
- - Is bitcoin trading not a sign of the antichrist?
  - Is stock market trading the sign of the AntiChrist? What about two children trading baseball cards? What about receiving a pay check and going to the grocery store to buy milk? All of these things are trade and BitCoin trading is no different than these other things. 
- - Is bitcoin halal and what do you think of Israel becoming a bitcoin hub?
  - Why wouldn’t it be? It’s more like Gold than any money today. It is also all debit, no credit, and there is no interestmechanism bakedin. Israel is also just a techhub in general. They were the first to get on drones and selfdriving cars too. It’s expected they would jump on Bitcoin too. 
- - The cost which is paid to miners to speed up confirmations in Bitcoin is rising exponentially. How can Bitcoin solve this and still succeed?
  - It won’t, the miners have become too powerful of an interest group. Bitcoin is effectively a dead protocol at this point which will only exist as a reminder of what not to do in the future. Everyone who has any predictive capability in these markets is moving into Monero or Decred both of which are significantly improved versions of Bitcoin. Essentially, all the dumb money is flowing into BTC while the smart money moves into altcoins. 
- - Should I invest in Bitcoin if I only have $5000?
  - Theres nowhere else to put your money. With interest rates at near 0% worldwide and even negative in Sweden 0.50 and Switzerland 0.75 leaving ones money in the bank doesnt even cover inflation.

- - How is buying the NYSE Bitcoin index NYXBT different from buying Bitcoin directly?
  - NYXBT isn’t a fund that you can invest in. It’s a price index that tracks the price of bitcoin. If it was a fund, then you would presumably be able to go long on it buy it with the expectation it will go up in value, or short it borrow someone else’s shares to sell it with the expectation that it will go down in price by the time you buy them back, so you can make a profit or loss on the difference. 
- - How can I buy Bitcoin with the help of a debit card?
  - I mainly use these two options It also offers very competitive prices. You can buy bitcoins or ethereum for fiat and then exchange those to a few altcoins if you prefer. The verification process is minimal. You will have to undergo a quick verification process, but it shouldn’t take longer than an hour to be fully approved. I think you can not use debit card for this. 
- - On June 15 2017, Bitcoin and ethereum were rapidly decreasing in price. Is it possible that Bitcoin and Ether will go up again?
  - It’s the part and parcel of being a trader. Nothing can go up forever and Nothing can stay down forever. Before investing you should be asking yourself, Bulls Make Money, Bears Make Money, Pigs Get Slaughtered  The Motley Fool Also, as cryptocurrency is a volatile market, always diversify your portfolio and only invest as much as you are willing to lose. Hope this helps! Of course. As much as I want to leave it there I’ll give you my 2 cents.

- - Is China likely to ban bitcoin?
  - China can not ban bitcoin per say. But recently, 2 of Chinas leading exchanges namely BTCC and ViaBTC have announced that they would stop all trading from 30th September indicating that China has decided to ban all exchanges from trading. It is highly possible that all other exchanges in China would halt trading and this would be a big blow to overall crypto world. I assume that the price of BTC may drop to as low as 2000 USD if this happens. 
- - What according to you all is better, Ripple or Bitcoin?
  - Ripple Vs Bitcoin Bitcoin and Ether have been dominated headlines in the crypto world for much of 2017, except for the occasional article about smaller coins with insane value returns.

Both, of course, have also had staggering growth in 2017.

  - Yes! Not bitcoin, but Ethereum. You can always convert your Ether to Btc afterwards so this shouldn’t be a problem.

Admittedly, as I merely skimmed their site I might not have the full details. 
- - Can my Bitcoin transactions be tracked in India?

So if it happens, investors can earn a good benefit on this. 
- - Where can I buy a physical Bitcoin?
  - Bitcoin private keys are just basically information. It can be stored digitally or physically. Denarium is a leading Physical Bitcoin manufacturer and we produces highquality premium collection coins from gold and silver. There is also affordable coins which focus on the usability.

The information private key is always stored some physical media like hard drive, paper, brain, memory etc.

The first way is to invest in “futures.” In simple terms, futures are a contract in which you agree to buy or sell a commodity at some time in the future for an agreedupon price. 
- - SatoshiPay switches from Bitcoin blockchain to IOTA. Will more and more companies switch from Bitcoin to its alternatives? Then what will be the future of Bitcoin?
  - Bitcoin will always be popular its the front runner, countries are trying to regulate control it, wealthy and multimillion dollar companies and investing, this boosting the value and cap of it. But like for front runners, there will always be a tweak for coming out with a “better” currency. Some will fail. Others may boom not quite like BitCoin though. The future of Bitcoin where it may be 100k in 10 years could very well happen but imo I dont believe anything will come close to it. Before exploring other coins and trying to find the next BitCoin, research BitCoin itself and find what made it so different in the first place. 
- - What are the future risks of losing money through Bitcoin?
  - Critics have been saying the same thing about Bitcoin for 7 years and it is stronger than ever.

- - It is true that Bitcoin will go down to $2221 once it has reached $4827?
  - The most important thing you can learn from the technical analysts calling price ceilings and floors for Bitcoin price movements is that Bitcoin is now effectively dominated by Wall Street speculator cash. The stock market and Bitcoin price can now be expected to share some correlation where before if anything it was hypothesized that Bitcoin would be an effective hedge as a form of ‘digital gold.’ The fundamental value of Bitcoin hasn’t changed very much from the start of the year when Bitcoin was trading under $2,000 per coin; what’s changed is how many speculators are interested in tradeable widgets in a hot new market that always goes up.

  - In a word No. Futures markets don’t set prices in any underlying commodity or metric. However, trading in futures will be indicative of price and will influence price in the underlying commodity  in this case Bitcoin.

- - Will Bitcoin control the world economy?
  - Bitcoin? Maybe. Crypto currencies in general? Absolutely. Forget everything you know about the whole crypto market for a minute. What’s important, here, is that the world economy is terribly inefficient. Money laundering is hilariously easy, and the system has so many moving parts that it’s surprising the last financial crash was a decade ago. Is it a coincidence that bitcoin was created around the same time … ?

Same thing with Bitcoin. 
- - Why do we need math problems to solve for bitcoin mining?
  - It’s not really a math problem. We need those math problems for the system to be more secure. The maximum size of a block is 1 MB .

The problems got so hard that the computers split their work with other computers to be more efficient in finding a solution.

- - Why are there no substantial American bitcoin exchanges?
  - Regulation.   If you try to start a US bitcoin exchange, you are looking at regulation from state money services businesses and the SEC and the CFTC.  You could try to get around those regulations by paying lots of lawyers, but at that point your exchange fees are going to be totally uncompetitive with exchanges in China.   Also, if you dont pay lots of money to lawyers, no bank will open an account.

- - Can Bitcoin help alleviate poverty?
  - Let me tell you a story, a real one Above, precisely, is the conundrum Boyart addresses in his mural of esteemed Dutch painter Rembrandt whose life was marked by severe financial hardships despite his undeniable talent.

Hope that was helpful An upvote would be great! Be Positive! 
- - Is the Bitcoin hardfork better or worse than the softfork for the Bitcoin ecosystem?
  - Its worse for the ecosystem. This doesnt mean its worse from a technical standpoint. It is worse for the ecosystem in that it is more disruptive to the holders of the coins.

It takes more knowledge to go this route. A soft fork doesnt require all this hassle. A YouTube Cryptocurrency News Host, Analyst and Educator 
- - Are the owners of Bitcoin allowed to pull the plug on Bitcoin?
  - Bitcoin is distributed ledger based. Anyone who is interested can mine and secure the network. Everybody owns it!

- - Should you invest in bitcoin cash or litcoin?
  - Litecoin is still a solid buy although it might take a breather since it already went up 200% within the last few weeks and over 300% within the last month. Plus Charlie Lee did say he sold all of his LTC due to conflict of interest. I’m not sure why he did that, did not seem like a smart move. As for Bitcoin cash, it is now hovering around $3300, over a 100% jump. That is because Coinbase announced they will be adding BCH as the forth coin they will supporting on the platform. 
- - What happens to the cash society if Bitcoin is totally successful?
  - There are a lot of variables that need to be accounted for, before a concrete answer be given for this question. 
- - How high will Bitcoin get by the end of this year? Why?
  - By studying the recent action, we could be anywhere. Hope this helps? 1 million dollars a coin. Or 2 million. Really, the sky is the limit. If someone is willing to pay that much for it, that is. Or it could go to $0.00 Nobody knows. Theres potential for it to soar or evaporate. However, I believe we are about to explode. Not sure when, but I feel it coming. I think we will see 35k this year. If we hit 35k by June, well get even higher by November. Just my take. 
- - Is it possible to enforce a ban on Bitcoin?
  - My take on this issue in response to a very similar question at Quora Can Governments Ban Bitcoin? In this posting, I break down the question like this Governments can ban Bitcoin, but the ban cannot be very effective.

Are the reasons and goals practical and legitimate?

  - XRP prices have since plummeted from their January 4 high of £2.83 $3.84, dragging down the market cap, but some analysts still see the potential for Ripple to overtake bitcoin “soon”. Ripple is now the third most valuable crypto token, trading at £1.84 $2.50 with a staggering market cap of more than £68billion $93billion on CoinMarketCap. According to CNBC’s Arjun Kharpal, Ripple would need to hit less than £5.16 $7 to surpassing bitcoin’s market cap value of of £181billion $246billion. 
- - How will futures trading on CME affect the Bitcoin price?
  - It obviously led to a shortterm surge, but I don’t think it’s big news. The Cboe announced plans earlier this year, and is likely to launch first. The CME contract will be similar to the Cboe, it will just use different exchanges for determining settlement rate. If the Cboe contract flops, or cannot be approved, the CME contract will likely do the same. If the Cboe contract succeeds, no one doubted that CME would soon follow. So this really isn’t news. 
- - How much Bitcoin BTC / Ethereum ETH would you keep at Coinbase? How much do you trust Coinbase wallet?
  - Most of the answers here give similar responses so I wont bother repeating that but there is also something to consider that I have not seen mentioned.

Move all your coins to cold storage. 
- - Will Bitcoin eventually split like shares?
  - This is one of the most common misunderstandings about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are digital assets and can be divided.

- - Can you explain Bitcoin to me in the simplest of way?
  - I need tomatoes and have excess of potatoes. You need potatoes and have excess of tomatoes.

To avoid the situation ‘double coincidence of needs’, money as a medium of exchange is evolved. 
- - Why did the Bitcoin creator decide to remain anonymous?
  - Bitcoin originated with the cypherpunks A cypherpunk UK /ˈsʌɪfəpʌŋk/ US /ˈsʌɪfərpʌŋk/[1] is any activist advocating widespread use of strong cryptography and privacyenhancing technologies as a route to social and political change.

  - Ritz home – JenkinsRM Buy and Hodl. that’s right ‘hodl’ Cheers, Jaxx 
- - How can I invest in Bitcoin cash using Bitcoin? Is it worth investing in Bitcoin Cash?
  - No one knows the destiny of Bitcoin Cash. It might go up or way down. Most wallets will support the Bitcoin which has the longest chain which means if Bitcoin Cash is not mined it would consequently go to zero. In addition, not many people talk about it. Another thing is that there is a large number of people with no access to Bitcoin Cash after the fork as only few exchanges supported it. So potentially, there is a wait to sell building up. 
- - When will Bitcoin finally be gone?
  - When another cryptocurrency supplants it. 
- - What is the best strategy to benefit from the anticipated Bitcoin for scheduled fork on Nov 16?
  - Hold your Bitcoin, tight. What happens when news comes out that China wants to ban Bitcoin? The price drops/crashed. What happens when there’s a fork? The price has a bull run up, Bitcoin drains the entire market because investors are looking to get their share of the new ‘free’ coin. What happens after the fork? The price of BTC drops and the market revives, investors move back into the alts. Once you’ve been in crypto you realise that this entire market is one big see saw.

And even then, it took another year of incubating for myself to become serious in this field.

  - I assume you mean with the explosion of fees and delays during peak traffic in December? I wouldn’t say that’s proof that it can’t scale.

The list does not end.

Basically the place is trying to convert itself into a mature, enterprise company. There were too many young folks running the place that had no prior experience. 
- - Will Bitcoin hit the doors of Rs 1,000,000?

They were lucky to get such returns and I’d recommended all such people should immediately convert if not all a major part of their crypto currency to legal money.

- - How will the Bitcoin network operate after the 21mil bitcoins are issued?
  - Individuals who mine Bitcoins needn’t be miners. We call them ‘miners’ because they are awarded BTC as they solve mathematical computations.

They are more accurately engaged in transaction validation or ‘bookkeeping’.

- - How would you explain Bitcoin to your mom?
  - A humble attempt to interpret BitCoin and Blockchain simple as a story. What is money? literally ? Money is the representation of worth or value that we are holding, using a medium or an instrument provided by any central authority or any trusted third party.

So when you hold a RS 2000 note, you are holding a piece of representation made by RBI equivalent to worth of RS 2000/ 
- - Can bitcoin survive the current hype?
  - To insinuate that the rise of Bitcoin value is a hype makes it a huge understatement. The value of Bitcoin from my perspective can be sum by Value and Greed. The Values that Bitcoin brings to the 21st century economic table is one of Adoption to a new way of understanding value and Global Financial Reform. As the “Godfather” introducing Blockchain Technology to the world there are several aspects that genuinely attract the global community given how majority of the populations financial institutions operate. For example this technology enables sharing of data, transparency of transaction and value, verification of information without the intervention of an authoritative financial institution like a bank or government entity including but not limit to digital certification of assets. These example are some of the few reason why Bitcoin is genuinely believed to be the break through for a Global Financial Reform. This brings us to Greed. Given its Success in the last 9 years since its inception, we have seen that investors all over the world from your average high school teenager to the Chairman and CEO of JP Morgan has invested to make a quick buck. This is because when it comes to Greed although people may be Bias as the Chairman and CEO of JP Morgan has shown us in various distasteful commentary of Bitcoin/Blockchain and its uses being limited by the powers that be longevity, opportunities are not.

But soon the current bubble and hype will also blown. And some peoples may get shock of life because of it. And then it will grow again slow and steadily 
- - Is the raise of Bitcoin to $10,000 a bubble?
  - The higher the prices go the more financial experts are warning us in the news. Don’t buy, it’s a scam! It’s used for money laundering.

They don’t understand what is going on now either.

The similar case is for person B as well . 
- - What is the prediction on how low Bitcoin will go?
  - If you want to know how low Bitcoin can go you should look at the charts. It shows you that it is possible for Bitcoin to drop massively. Most of the time if bounces back up. Who knows how next time will be? Everyone always freaks out during dips and panic sells leading to even greater drops. What I do know is that for most people BTC is still the entrance to cryptocurrency is general. 
- - What are your predictions for Bitcoin as of August 2017 all the way to the end of the year?
  - Bitcoin is at all time high. After the recent fork, people expected it to fail and many people sold their Bitcoins but unfortunately for them it didn’t work out according to their plans. There’s no other major changes scheduled for Bitcoin this yearso far, it is very much stable. Bitcoin has arose interest among people of all class, because Bitcoin is limited 16M in the market, maybe less after the fork. “High demand, low supply” will only point to price rise. 
- - Why did Bitcoin rise today 29th August 2017?
  - Lets look at what is happening in bitcoin recently. Bitcoin jumps nearly 70% for August to record high, offshoot bitcoin cash falls to more than oneweek low. I think i will stick to the leader BITCOIN. Not the offshoot. Bitcoin climbed to a record high above $4,700. Remember the coin has a limited supply to be mined, and will become a rarity soon! Just like in the gold rush! Here are 14 tops things most crypto investors are not looking at  
- - Will bitcoin ever reach its peak as in peak oil, where the resource needed to mine a bitcoin is more valuable than the coin itself?
  - Its not possible. Even if it will ever happen, its not in the next 500,000 years. Peak is a relative term, no one knows what the peak will be and when. As far as the demand and supply is there bitcoin will keep reaching ATHs, unless it is replaced by other better crypto currencies which will not happen anytime soon. 
- - Now that Bitcoin price is on free fall, do you think this is the big price correction that everyone has predected? Will Bitcoin cross 5000$ anytime soon?
  - But leave all of that. Despite its merits, the ground for the debate remains the same, usage of bitcoin in the real world. There are more challenges for bitcoin, challenges like governmental laws which can potentially make bitcoin illegal the next moment, another is to convince people to shift towards using bitcoin. So I thought I’d bump the thread a bit. 5000 USD has come and gone, we’re now looking at 3 times that price and many are thinking that the last strong support is at 5000 USD. 
- - Is a very small group of people controlling the price of Bitcoin? Could the volatility of Bitcoin be hints of a coordinated attack from that group?
  - It would be great to get an analysis from major exchanges on the proportion of Bitcoin traded by the biggest buyers and sellers. My feeling is that Bitcoin has a wide enough ownership to make price control difficult and risky. For example if a small group dump their Bitcoin in the hope of picking it up cheaply the next day, they face the risk that the market absorbs their sales and that the price rises, causing them to lose money. 
- - What are the incentives for business to accept bitcoin?
